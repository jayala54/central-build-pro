A basic office refresh (new paint, flooring, and fixtures) may cost $40 to $60 per square foot, while a full restaurant remodel or medical office renovation can exceed $150 per square foot. Structural modifications, ADA upgrades, and code compliance work add to the cost. J&N StructureWorks provides detailed, line-item estimates based on your specific project requirements."},{q:"How do you minimize disruption to my business during renovation?",a:"We understand that every day of disruption costs your business money. Our approach includes phased construction schedules that allow portions of your space to remain operational, after-hours and weekend work when needed, dust and noise containment barriers, and clear communication about what to expect each week. For restaurants and retail spaces, we can often schedule the most disruptive work during your slowest periods. We create a detailed phasing plan during pre-construction so you know exactly how the renovation will impact your operations."},{q:"What permits are needed for a commercial renovation in Florida?",a:"Commercial renovations in Florida typically require building permits for any structural modifications, electrical permits for wiring changes, plumbing permits for fixture or pipe changes, and mechanical permits for HVAC modifications. If you are changing the use of the space (e.g., converting retail to restaurant), additional zoning approvals and a change-of-use permit may be required. Fire alarm and fire suppression permits are also common. As a Florida Certified Building Contractor (CBC1269175), J&N StructureWorks handles all permit applications and inspections throughout your project."},{q:"Can you bring my older commercial building up to current code?",a:"Yes. Many older commercial buildings in Central Florida were built under previous versions of the Florida Building Code and may not meet current standards for fire safety, accessibility, electrical capacity, or structural performance. We specialize in code compliance upgrades that bring existing buildings up to current standards, including ADA accessibility improvements, fire alarm and sprinkler system upgrades, electrical panel replacements, and structural reinforcement. We work with local building officials to determine which code requirements apply to your specific renovation scope."},{q:"How long does a commercial renovation take?",a:"Commercial renovation timelines vary significantly based on the scope of work. A cosmetic refresh of a 3,000 sq ft office may take 3 to 5 weeks, while a full restaurant remodel or major structural renovation of 5,000+ sq ft can take 8 to 16 weeks. The permitting process typically adds 2 to 6 weeks before construction begins. We develop a detailed project schedule during pre-construction that accounts for permitting, material lead times, and any phasing required to minimize business disruption."}];function F(){const l=()=>{window.location.href="/Contact"};return e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-gray-50",children:[e.jsx(m,{title:"Commercial Renovations Orlando & Central Florida",path:"/CommercialRenovations",description:"Professional commercial renovations in Orlando & Central Florida by J&N StructureWorks.
