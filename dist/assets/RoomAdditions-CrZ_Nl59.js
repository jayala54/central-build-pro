A standard 400 sq ft bedroom addition may cost $60,000 to $140,000, while a more complex two-story addition or one requiring significant foundation work can exceed $200,000. Garage conversions are generally more affordable at $50 to $150 per square foot since the structure already exists. J&N StructureWorks provides detailed estimates during our free consultation."},{q:"Do I need a permit for a room addition in Florida?",a:"Yes, room additions in Florida always require building permits. You will typically need permits for the structural work, electrical, plumbing (if applicable), and mechanical (HVAC) systems. If your property is in an HOA community, you will also need architectural review board approval before construction begins. Additionally, additions must comply with local setback requirements, lot coverage limits, and Florida Building Code. As a Florida Certified Building Contractor (CBC1269175), J&N StructureWorks handles all permit applications and inspections on your behalf."},{q:"How long does it take to build a room addition?",a:"A typical room addition in Central Florida takes 2 to 5 months from permit approval to completion. A simple single-room addition (bedroom, office, or family room) may be completed in 8 to 12 weeks, while more complex additions involving a second story, new bathroom, or kitchen expansion can take 4 to 6 months. The permitting process itself typically adds 2 to 6 weeks before construction begins. We provide a detailed timeline during the planning phase."},{q:"Can you match the addition to my existing home's style?",a:"Absolutely. Matching the addition to your existing home is one of our top priorities. We carefully match rooflines, exterior finishes (stucco, siding, brick), window styles, trim details, and interior elements so the addition looks like it was always part of the original home. We source materials that match or complement your existing finishes and work with you on design details to ensure a seamless transition between old and new construction."},{q:"What types of room additions can you build?",a:"We build all types of residential additions including extra bedrooms, master suite additions, family room expansions, home office additions, sunrooms, in-law suites, garage conversions, second-story additions, and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). We also handle kitchen expansions, bathroom additions, and bump-outs that add square footage to existing rooms. Each project is custom-designed to integrate with your existing home and meet your specific needs."}];function A(){const l=()=>{window.location.href="/Contact"};return e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-gray-50",children:[e.jsx(m,{title:"Room Additions Contractor Orlando FL",path:"/RoomAdditions",description:"Professional room additions in Orlando & Central Florida by J&N StructureWorks.
