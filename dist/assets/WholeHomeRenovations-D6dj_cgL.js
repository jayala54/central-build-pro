For a 2,000 sq ft home, expect a total investment between $200,000 and $500,000+. Cosmetic-focused renovations (new flooring, paint, fixtures) fall on the lower end, while gut renovations involving structural work, new plumbing, and electrical rewiring fall on the higher end. J&N StructureWorks provides a detailed, line-item estimate during our free consultation."},{q:"How long does a whole-home renovation take?",a:"A comprehensive whole-home renovation in Central Florida typically takes 3 to 8 months depending on the size of the home and the scope of work. Cosmetic renovations may be completed in 6 to 10 weeks, while full gut renovations that involve structural modifications, roof work, and complete system replacements can take 6 to 12 months. We build a detailed project schedule before construction begins and provide regular progress updates."},{q:"Can I live in my home during a whole-home renovation?",a:"It depends on the scope of work. For phased renovations where we work on one area at a time, you may be able to stay in the home. For full gut renovations that involve removing walls, replacing plumbing and electrical systems, or significant structural changes, we strongly recommend making temporary living arrangements. We can phase your project to minimize displacement when possible and will advise you on the best approach during the planning stage."},{q:"What permits are needed for a whole-home renovation in Florida?",a:"Whole-home renovations in Florida typically require building permits for structural work, electrical permits for wiring changes, plumbing permits for pipe modifications, and mechanical permits for HVAC work. If you live in an HOA community, architectural approval may also be required. As a Florida Certified Building Contractor (CBC1269175), J&N StructureWorks handles all permit applications, inspections, and regulatory approvals on your behalf."},{q:"Is it cheaper to renovate or build new in Central Florida?",a:"In most cases, renovating is more cost-effective than building new — especially when the existing structure, foundation, and lot are in good condition. A whole-home renovation typically costs 30–50% less than new construction of comparable size and quality. However, if the existing home has major structural issues, foundation problems, or outdated systems throughout, new construction may be the better long-term investment. We can evaluate your specific situation during a free consultation and help you determine the best path forward."}];function W(){const l=()=>{window.location.href="/Contact"};return e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-gray-50",children:[e.jsx(m,{title:"Whole-Home Renovations Orlando & Central Florida",path:"/WholeHomeRenovations",description:"Complete whole-home renovations in Orlando & Central Florida by J&N StructureWorks.
