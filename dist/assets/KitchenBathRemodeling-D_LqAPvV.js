A mid-range kitchen remodel averages around $40,000 to $55,000, while a high-end renovation with custom cabinetry, stone countertops, and premium appliances can exceed $80,000. J&N StructureWorks provides detailed, line-item estimates during our free consultation so you know exactly where every dollar goes."},{q:"How long does a bathroom renovation take in Central Florida?",a:"A standard bathroom renovation in Central Florida typically takes 3 to 6 weeks from demolition to final walkthrough. A simple cosmetic refresh (new tile, vanity, and fixtures) may take 2 to 3 weeks, while a full gut renovation involving plumbing relocation, structural changes, or expanding the footprint can take 6 to 10 weeks. We provide a detailed project timeline before work begins and keep you updated throughout the process."},{q:"Do I need a permit for a kitchen or bathroom remodel in Orlando?",a:"Yes, permits are typically required in Orlando and Orange County for any work involving electrical, plumbing, or structural modifications. Cosmetic updates like painting or replacing cabinet hardware generally do not require permits. As a Florida Certified Building Contractor (CBC1269175), J&N StructureWorks handles all permit applications and inspections on your behalf, ensuring your project is fully code-compliant."},{q:"What is the ROI on a kitchen or bathroom remodel in Florida?",a:"According to national remodeling cost-vs-value data, a mid-range kitchen remodel typically recoups 60–80% of its cost at resale, while bathroom renovations recoup 55–75%. In the competitive Central Florida real estate market, updated kitchens and bathrooms are among the most valuable improvements you can make. Beyond resale value, these renovations significantly improve daily livability and comfort."},{q:"Can I stay in my home during a kitchen or bathroom remodel?",a:"In most cases, yes. For bathroom remodels, you can typically continue living in the home as long as you have access to another bathroom. For kitchen remodels, we help you set up a temporary kitchen area with essentials like a microwave, mini-fridge, and portable cooktop. We also take steps to minimize dust and noise disruption with dust barriers and clear work schedules."}];function F(){const l=()=>{window.location.href="/Contact"};return e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-gray-50",children:[e.jsx(m,{title:"Kitchen & Bathroom Remodeling Orlando FL",path:"/KitchenBathRemodeling",description:"Professional kitchen and bathroom remodeling in Orlando & Central Florida by J&N StructureWorks.
