    content: `## What New Builds Actually Cost in Central Florida

We get this question more than any other. People want a number, and the honest answer is that it depends. But we can give you real ranges based on what we're seeing on the ground across Orange, Seminole, Osceola, and Lake counties right now.

### Cost Per Square Foot in 2025

Right now, you're looking at somewhere between **$150 and $250+ per square foot** for a new build in the Central Florida area. That range is wide because finishes, lot conditions, and which county you're in make a big difference. Here's how it breaks down:

- **Budget-conscious builds:** $150 to $180/sq ft. You're getting a solid home with builder-grade finishes. Nothing wrong with that.
- **Mid-range [custom homes](/CustomHomes):** $180 to $220/sq ft. Upgraded cabinets, quartz counters, better tile. This is where most of our clients land.
- **High-end custom builds:** $220 to $300+/sq ft. We're talking custom everything, premium materials, smart home systems, the works.

### What's Actually in That Number?

A full construction budget covers more than just walls and a roof:

1. **Site Work and Foundation** - Clearing the lot, grading, hauling in fill dirt, and pouring the concrete slab
2. **Framing and Roofing** - Structural lumber, trusses, sheathing, and your roofing material
3. **Mechanical Systems** - Plumbing lines, electrical wiring, and HVAC equipment
4. **Interior Finishes** - Drywall, flooring, cabinetry, countertops, and paint
5. **Exterior Finishes** - Stucco, siding, windows, and doors
6. **[Permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) and Impact Fees** - These vary a lot depending on the county, and they add up fast

### Costs That Sneak Up on You

First-time builders almost always get surprised by a few line items that aren't in the base quote:

- **Impact fees** can run anywhere from **$5,000 to $20,000+** depending on whether you're in Orange County, Osceola, or elsewhere
- **Utility connections** for water, sewer, and electric can tack on **$3,000 to $15,000**. If you're on a rural lot off Avalon Road or out past Christmas, it could be even more.
- **Soil testing and surveying** usually costs **$2,000 to $5,000**
- **Landscaping and the driveway** are almost never included in builder quotes. Budget separately for those.

### Keeping Your Build on Budget

- Get a detailed, itemized estimate. If someone just gives you a per-square-foot price and won't break it down, that's a problem.
- Set aside **10 to 15%** as a contingency fund. Things come up. They always do.
- Pick your lot carefully. A lot with bad soil or a high water table on the east side of Orange County is going to cost more to build on than a clean lot in [Clermont](/ServiceAreaClermont).
- Lock in material prices early when you can. Lumber and concrete prices still fluctuate.

At J&N StructureWorks, we give you a transparent, itemized estimate before we ever break ground. No guesswork, no ugly surprises at the end.`

    content: `## Finding a Lot That Won't Wreck Your Budget

The lot you pick will affect every part of your [custom home](/CustomHomes) build. A bad lot can add **$20,000 or more** in unexpected costs before you even pour a foundation. We've seen it happen too many times, so we always tell people to slow down at this stage.

### What to Look at Before You Buy

#### 1. Zoning and Land Use
Call the county planning department before you get emotionally attached to a piece of land. You need to confirm:
- The property is actually zoned for residential construction
- Minimum lot size requirements for building
- Setback requirements, which tell you how close to the property lines you can build
- Height restrictions and any deed restrictions or HOA rules that could limit your plans

If you're looking at a lot in unincorporated Seminole County versus a lot inside the City of [Sanford](/ServiceAreaSanford), the rules could be completely different. Always check.

#### 2. Soil Conditions
Florida soil is unpredictable. Two lots across the street from each other can have totally different conditions. A **geotechnical soil test** (usually $1,500 to $3,000) tells you:
- Whether the soil can actually support a slab foundation
- How deep the water table sits
- If you'll need extra fill dirt or some kind of soil stabilization work

Out near Narcoossee Road and down through St. Cloud, we've run into some really tricky soil conditions. Don't skip this step.

#### 3. Flood Zone Status
Pull up the FEMA flood maps for any lot you're considering. If you're in a flood zone, that means:
- Your insurance premiums go way up
- You'll likely need an elevated foundation
- Additional engineering costs get added to the build

Areas along the Little Econlockhatchee River, the St. Johns River corridor, and parts of [Kissimmee](/ServiceAreaKissimmee) can be flood-prone. Check before you commit.

#### 4. Utility Access
Make sure you know what's available at the lot:
- **Municipal water and sewer** or will you need a well and septic system? Septic adds cost and limits where you can build on the lot.
- **Electric service** and how far away the nearest transformer is. FPL or Duke Energy will charge you for running lines if the distance is far enough.
- **Internet and cable** matter more than people think, especially if you work from home. Rural lots west of Apopka or south of Poinciana can have limited options.

#### 5. Tree and Environmental Surveys
Most Central Florida counties require tree surveys before you can clear a lot. If you've got a mature live oak on the property, you might need a permit and possibly mitigation to remove it. Some trees can't be removed at all.

### Red Flags to Walk Away From

- A lot priced way below comparable parcels nearby. There's always a reason.
- Standing water on the lot after a rain. That's a drainage problem waiting to become your problem.
- Land adjacent to retention ponds or wetlands. Building setbacks from these can eat up a big chunk of your buildable area.
- Narrow or oddly shaped parcels that limit where the house can actually sit

### Bring Your Builder Along

We evaluate lots alongside our clients at J&N StructureWorks before they sign anything. We can spot issues that most buyers would miss and give you an honest cost estimate for what it'll take to build on that specific piece of land.`

    content: `## How the Orange County Permit Process Works

The permit process in Orange County isn't complicated, but it does take time. If you don't understand the steps, you're going to end up with delays that push your whole project back. We've pulled permits on dozens of builds in [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) and Orange County, so we know what to expect.

### Permits You'll Need for a New Home

For a standard [single-family build](/CustomHomes), you're filing for:

1. **Building Permit** - This is the big one covering all structural work
2. **Electrical Permit** - Covers wiring, panel installation, and all electrical systems
3. **Plumbing Permit** - Water supply and drainage
4. **Mechanical Permit** - HVAC ductwork and equipment
5. **Land Clearing Permit** - Required if you're removing trees or heavy vegetation from the lot

### Step by Step Through the Process

1. **Submit your plans** to the Orange County Building Division. You'll need architectural drawings, engineering plans, and a site plan. Everything goes through their online portal now.
2. **Plan review** takes about **2 to 4 weeks** for residential projects. Could be faster, could be slower depending on how backed up they are.
3. **Respond to comments** if the reviewer flags anything. They might ask for structural modifications or additional detail on your plans. Turn these around fast.
4. **Pick up your permit** once it's approved and post it where inspectors can see it at the job site.
5. **Schedule inspections** at each construction milestone. Don't get ahead of yourself. If you pour your slab before the foundation inspection, you've got a problem.

### Inspection Checkpoints

These are the stops along the way:

- Foundation and slab inspection
- Framing inspection
- Rough-in inspections for plumbing, electrical, and mechanical
- Insulation inspection
- Final inspection and your Certificate of Occupancy (CO)

Miss an inspection or fail one, and work stops until it's resolved. That's just how it goes.

### Impact Fees in Orange County

Orange County charges impact fees that fund roads, schools, parks, and other infrastructure. For a single-family home, budget for **$10,000 to $18,000** in total impact fees. The exact amount depends on the size and location of your home.

These are due at the time you pull your permit, so they need to be in your [budget from day one](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida).

### Getting Through It Smoothly

- Make sure your plans are complete and code-compliant before you submit. Incomplete submissions get kicked back, and you lose weeks.
- When comments come in, address them the same day if you can
- Never start work before the permit is issued. Orange County doesn't mess around with that.
- Keep every inspection record organized. You'll need them at closing and for your CO.

J&N StructureWorks handles the entire permitting process for our clients, from plan submission through the final Certificate of Occupancy. We deal with the county so you don't have to.`

    content: `## A Realistic Look at Your Build Timeline

Most [custom homes](/CustomHomes) in Central Florida take **8 to 14 months** from contract to move-in. Some people hear that and think it sounds long. Others think it sounds short. Either way, knowing what happens at each stage helps you plan your life around the build.

### Phase 1: Pre-Construction (4 to 8 Weeks)
This is the paperwork and planning phase. It doesn't feel like much is happening, but this is where the foundation for a smooth build gets laid.
- Finalize your floor plans and specifications
- Complete engineering and site plans
- Submit for [building permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) (expect the county to take 2 to 4 weeks)
- Order any long-lead materials like custom windows, specialty trusses, or specific tile

### Phase 2: Site Work and Foundation (2 to 3 Weeks)
Now you'll actually see dirt moving. This is when it gets real.
- Clear and grade the lot
- Install underground plumbing and utility connections
- Pour the concrete slab foundation
- **Inspection milestone:** Foundation and slab

### Phase 3: Framing (3 to 4 Weeks)
The house starts to take shape. This is the part where clients get excited because you can finally walk through the rooms.
- Put up walls, set roof trusses, and install sheathing
- Hang windows and exterior doors
- Apply roof underlayment and roofing material
- **Inspection milestone:** Framing

### Phase 4: Rough-Ins (3 to 4 Weeks)
The guts of the house go in. Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC all happen during this phase.
- Install plumbing supply and drain lines
- Run electrical wiring and set the panel
- Install HVAC ductwork and the air handler
- **Inspection milestones:** Plumbing, electrical, and mechanical rough-ins

### Phase 5: Insulation and Drywall (2 to 3 Weeks)
- Install insulation in the walls and attic
- Hang drywall, tape the seams, and finish it smooth
- **Inspection milestone:** Insulation (happens before drywall goes up)

### Phase 6: Interior Finishes (4 to 6 Weeks)
This is the longest finish phase, and it's where your house starts to feel like a home.
- Cabinetry and countertop installation
- Flooring goes down (tile, LVP, hardwood, whatever you picked)
- Interior paint on walls and trim
- Light fixtures, hardware, and appliances get installed

### Phase 7: Exterior Finishes (2 to 3 Weeks)
- Stucco or siding application
- Gutters and downspouts
- Driveway and walkways get poured
- Landscaping and irrigation system installation

### Phase 8: Final Inspections and Close-Out (1 to 2 Weeks)
The finish line. Almost there.
- Final building inspection by the county
- Certificate of Occupancy gets issued
- Final walkthrough with you, the homeowner
- Punch list items get knocked out (small touch-ups, adjustments, etc.)

### What Causes Delays

Be realistic about these. They happen on almost every build:

- **Weather.** Florida's rainy season runs June through September, and afternoon thunderstorms can shut down exterior work for days at a time.
- **Permit review times.** Counties get backed up, especially during building booms. There's not much you can do but wait.
- **Material delays.** Custom windows, imported tile, and specialty items can take weeks. Order early.
- **Change orders.** Every time you change your mind during construction, it [costs time and money](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida). Make your decisions during pre-construction and stick with them.

J&N StructureWorks keeps clients updated at every phase. You'll always know where your build stands and what's coming next.`

    content: `## Open Concept or Defined Rooms? It Depends on How You Live.

This comes up in almost every design meeting. Clients come in knowing they want an open floor plan because that's what they've seen on HGTV for the last decade. And look, open plans are great. But they're not perfect for everyone, and there are good reasons to consider other options too.

### Open Floor Plans

**What works well:**
- The space feels bigger and airier, even in a smaller home
- Great for families who like to hang out together. You can cook while the kids are doing homework in the living room.
- Natural light flows through the whole area instead of getting trapped in one room
- Entertaining is easier when your kitchen, dining, and living areas are all connected

**What doesn't work as well:**
- Zero privacy. If someone's watching TV and someone else needs quiet, tough luck.
- Cooking smells fill the entire living space. Fish tacos on a Tuesday night? Everyone knows.
- Everything is always on display. There's no closing a door to hide the mess.
- You need to be more intentional with furniture placement to define the different zones

### Traditional Layouts with Defined Rooms

**What works well:**
- Better noise control between spaces
- Each room has a clear purpose
- Easier to heat and cool individual rooms efficiently
- More wall space for built-in storage, bookshelves, and artwork

**What doesn't work as well:**
- Can feel smaller and darker, even in a bigger house
- Interior rooms don't get much natural light
- You can't keep an eye on kids in the living room while you're in the kitchen

### Why Open Plans Make Extra Sense in Florida

Central Florida living is all about the indoors flowing into the outdoors. An open great room with **large sliding glass doors** that open to a covered lanai and pool is the dream setup. Florida's sunshine floods that kind of space beautifully.

If you're building in a community like [Lake Nona](/ServiceAreaLakeNona), Horizon West, or out in [Clermont](/ServiceAreaClermont) where lots tend to be bigger, an open plan with a big lanai is almost the default because it just fits the lifestyle.

### Most People End Up Going Hybrid

Honestly, the majority of our [custom home](/CustomHomes) clients at J&N StructureWorks do a mix. Open kitchen, living, and dining area. Then separate bedrooms, a dedicated home office, and maybe a bonus room with a door for the kids. You get the social space and the private space without compromising on either.

The right layout is the one that matches how your family actually spends their time at home, not what looks best in a magazine.`

    content: `## What a Kitchen Renovation Actually Looks Like

[Kitchens](/KitchenBathRemodeling) are the most popular renovation we do, and for good reason. A well-done kitchen upgrade makes your house more enjoyable to live in every single day. It also tends to return **60 to 80%** of its cost at resale, which makes it one of the smarter home improvement investments out there.

### What Kitchens Cost in Central Florida

Prices depend heavily on the scope. A cosmetic refresh and a full gut-job are two very different animals.

- **Cosmetic refresh:** $15,000 to $30,000. New cabinet faces, counters, backsplash, and maybe updated fixtures. You're keeping the existing layout.
- **Mid-range remodel:** $30,000 to $60,000. New cabinets, new countertops, updated flooring, new appliances, and some layout changes.
- **Full renovation:** $60,000 to $100,000+. Walls coming down, plumbing and electrical getting moved, custom cabinetry, premium everything.

### Where the Money Goes

1. **Cabinetry** eats up the biggest chunk, usually **30 to 40%** of the total budget. Semi-custom vs. fully custom makes a huge difference in price.
2. **Countertops** vary wildly. Quartz runs about **$50 to $100** per square foot installed. Marble and exotic granite push past **$150**.
3. **Appliances** for a full suite (fridge, range, dishwasher, microwave, hood) typically cost **$5,000 to $15,000** depending on brands.
4. **Flooring** is usually tile or luxury vinyl plank in Central Florida kitchens. Both hold up well to moisture and heavy foot traffic.
5. **Plumbing and electrical work** can blow up a budget fast if you're moving the sink, adding an island with a cooktop, or relocating outlets.

### What's Trending in 2025

- White or light-colored cabinets paired with warm wood accent pieces
- Large-format porcelain tile backsplashes, sometimes running all the way to the ceiling
- Waterfall-edge countertops on kitchen islands
- Integrated smart appliances with Wi-Fi connectivity
- Pot fillers above the range and touchless faucets at the sink

### How Long It Takes

Plan on **6 to 10 weeks** from demo day to the final walkthrough:
- Week 1: Demolition and any rough-in work
- Weeks 2 to 3: Electrical updates, plumbing changes, and drywall patching
- Weeks 4 to 5: Cabinet installation
- Weeks 6 to 7: Countertop templating, fabrication, and installation
- Weeks 8 to 10: Backsplash, fixtures, appliance install, and final touch-ups

Countertop fabrication is the usual bottleneck. Templates can't happen until cabinets are in, and fabrication takes 1 to 2 weeks after that.

### Making It Go Smoothly

- Set up a temporary kitchen somewhere else in the house. A folding table, a microwave, and a coffee maker in the garage goes a long way.
- Make every single material selection before demolition starts. Changing your mind on cabinet color in week 3 will push your timeline back by weeks.
- Budget **15%** above your base estimate for contingencies. Older homes in places like [Winter Park](/ServiceAreaWinterPark), College Park, and Maitland almost always have surprises behind the walls.
- Make sure your contractor is licensed and pulling [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida). Kitchen renovations in Florida require them.

    content: `## What You Should Know About Building in Seminole County

Seminole County does things a little differently from Orange and Osceola. The county is more built-out, the lots tend to be smaller, and the regulations are tighter in some areas. That doesn't mean it's harder to build here. You just need to know what you're working with.

### The Permit Process

Seminole County runs everything through an electronic plan review system, which actually makes things move a bit faster than some neighboring counties.

1. **Pre-application meeting** - Not required, but it's a good idea if your project has any unusual features or if the lot has quirks
2. **Submit plans electronically** through the county's online portal
3. **Plan review** takes about **10 to 15 business days** for residential projects
4. **Permit issuance** once your plans are approved and fees are paid
5. **Inspections** get scheduled through the county system. You can do it online.

The building department office is off Bush Boulevard in [Sanford](/ServiceAreaSanford) if you ever need to go in person, but most of it can be handled online.

### Regulations Worth Knowing

- **Setbacks** vary by zoning district. A lot in Longwood might have totally different setback requirements than one in [Oviedo](/ServiceAreaOviedo). Check your specific property's zoning.
- **Maximum lot coverage** is typically **35 to 45%** for residential zones. That limits how big you can build relative to the lot.
- **Hurricane protection** applies to all new construction. Everything has to meet Florida Building Code wind load requirements.
- **Tree protection** is strict in Seminole County. They don't take kindly to clearing a lot without proper permits and tree surveys.

### Impact Fees (2025 Estimates)

These are approximate for a single-family home:
- Transportation: roughly **$5,500**
- Schools: roughly **$4,800**
- Parks and Recreation: roughly **$1,200**
- Fire: roughly **$600**
- Law Enforcement: roughly **$400**
- **Total: approximately $12,500**

That's on the lower end compared to Osceola County, which is one reason some people look at Seminole County even though the land costs more.

### Things That Make Seminole County Unique

- A lot of Seminole County falls inside the **Wekiva Protection Area**. If your lot is in or near it (think areas around Wekiva Springs Road, Longwood, and parts of Sanford), you'll deal with additional environmental regulations around stormwater, septic, and clearing.
- **Septic systems** are still required in some unincorporated pockets without municipal sewer. The county health department handles those permits separately.
- Properties along the **St. Johns River corridor** have strict flood zone requirements. If you're looking at land near Geneva or along the river east of Sanford, get a flood determination early.

J&N StructureWorks has built extensively throughout Seminole County, from Winter Springs to [Lake Mary](/ServiceAreaLakeMary) to Oviedo. We know the local requirements and handle all the permitting, inspections, and regulatory work so you can focus on the fun part of designing your home.`

    content: `## Why Florida Homes Are Built Different

If you've moved here from somewhere up north, you probably noticed that construction looks different in Florida. There's a reason for that. The Florida Building Code is one of the strictest in the country when it comes to wind resistance, and every choice, from the concrete blocks to the roof straps, is designed to keep your house standing in a hurricane.

### What the Florida Building Code Requires

Every [new home](/CustomHomes) in Florida has to meet the FBC, and that includes some serious structural requirements:

- **Wind speed design** means your home must withstand sustained winds based on your specific location. In Central Florida, that's typically **130 to 150 mph**.
- **Impact protection** on all windows and doors. They need to be impact-rated or you need approved hurricane shutters. There's no middle ground.
- **Roof-to-wall connections** with hurricane straps or clips at every single truss-to-wall connection point.
- **Continuous load path** from roof to foundation. The whole structure needs to be tied together so wind forces transfer all the way down into the ground.

### The Features That Actually Matter

#### Impact-Rated Windows and Doors
These are the single best upgrade you can make. Impact windows:
- Stop wind-borne debris from penetrating the building envelope
- Provide excellent noise reduction (you'll notice this day to day, not just during storms)
- Block UV rays that fade furniture and flooring
- Eliminate the scramble to put up plywood or shutters when a storm is coming

They cost more upfront, but they pay for themselves in insurance savings and peace of mind.

#### Concrete Block Construction (CBS)
Most [Central Florida](/Services) homes are built with **CMU (concrete masonry unit)** walls. The blocks get reinforced with steel rebar and filled with concrete. It's a completely different animal from wood-frame construction when it comes to wind resistance. This is standard here and it's one of the reasons Florida homes hold up as well as they do.

#### Hip Roofs Over Gable Roofs
A hip roof slopes on all four sides. A gable roof has two flat ends that catch wind like a sail. In high winds, hip roofs perform significantly better because their shape reduces uplift forces. If you have the choice, go with a hip roof.

#### Engineered Roof Trusses
Modern trusses are designed by engineers using software that calculates exact wind loads for your location. Each one gets connected to the wall below with galvanized hurricane straps. Nothing is left to guesswork.

### Going Beyond the Minimum

At J&N StructureWorks, we usually recommend exceeding code minimums in a few key areas:

- **Heavy-duty hurricane straps** at every connection, not just the standard ones
- **Impact-rated garage doors**, because the garage opening is the most vulnerable spot on most homes. If that door fails, wind pressure can blow the roof off.
- **Secondary water barriers** under the roofing material as an extra layer of leak protection
- **Reinforced entry doors** with multi-point locking systems

### How This Saves You Money

Building above code can cut your homeowner's insurance premiums significantly. Many Florida insurers offer **wind mitigation discounts of 20 to 40%** when you can document specific hurricane-resistant features. Over the life of the home, those savings add up to tens of thousands of dollars.

Good construction isn't just about surviving a storm. It's about building something that protects your family and [saves you money](/Blog/energy-efficient-home-features) for decades.`

    content: `## Picking Flooring That Can Handle Florida

Flooring in Florida takes a beating. Between the humidity, the afternoon rainstorms that blow in through the lanai, and the sand that gets tracked in constantly, you need something that can hold up. Not every flooring material is cut out for it.

### Porcelain and Ceramic Tile

**Works best in:** [Bathrooms, kitchens](/KitchenBathRemodeling), entryways, and Florida rooms

Tile is a workhorse. It's extremely durable, completely water-resistant, and available in more styles than you could look through in a month. Wood-look porcelain planks are hugely popular right now, and some of them are hard to tell from real wood unless you touch them.

The one downside is that tile can feel cold underfoot during those few weeks of Florida "winter." Some people add area rugs. Others don't mind.

- **Cost:** $3 to $15 per square foot installed

### Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)

**Works best in:** Main living areas, bedrooms, and whole-house installations

LVP has taken over the Central Florida market and it's easy to see why. It's **100% waterproof**, warm and comfortable to walk on, and the better brands genuinely look like real hardwood. If you've got kids and dogs, this is probably your best option.

Installation is faster than tile, and if a plank gets damaged down the road, replacing a section is straightforward.

- **Cost:** $4 to $10 per square foot installed

### Engineered Hardwood

**Works best in:** Living rooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms

If you want real wood, go engineered rather than solid hardwood in Florida. The layered construction handles humidity swings much better. You can refinish most engineered hardwood once or twice depending on the veneer thickness.

Keep it out of bathrooms and laundry rooms though. Moisture is still its weakness.

- **Cost:** $6 to $15 per square foot installed

### Polished Concrete

**Works best in:** Modern, contemporary, and industrial-style homes

This one surprises people. Since Florida homes are built on concrete slabs, you've already got the floor. Polishing, staining, or scoring the existing slab gives you an incredibly durable, low-maintenance floor with a modern look.

We've done this in a few builds out in the [Lake Nona](/ServiceAreaLakeNona) and Horizon West areas, and clients love it.

- **Cost:** $3 to $8 per square foot to polish the existing slab

### What We Usually Recommend

For most of our [Central Florida builds](/CustomHomes), we suggest a combination approach:
- **LVP or large-format tile** throughout the main living areas and hallways
- **Porcelain tile** in all bathrooms and wet areas
- **Carpet** only in bedrooms, and only if you actually want it. A lot of our clients are skipping carpet entirely.

J&N StructureWorks helps clients pick flooring that fits their lifestyle, holds up to Florida's climate, and looks great. We'll walk you through samples and pricing so you can make a decision you won't regret.`

    content: `## Bathroom Renovations Gone Wrong (and How to Avoid It)

[Bathroom remodels](/KitchenBathRemodeling) can add real value to your home and make your morning routine about ten times better. But they can also go sideways fast if you don't plan carefully. We've cleaned up after enough botched bathroom jobs to know what goes wrong and why.

### 1. Underestimating the Budget
This is the number one mistake. People see a bathroom on Pinterest and assume they can get it for $10,000. In Central Florida, here's what you're actually looking at:
- **Half bath remodel:** $8,000 to $15,000
- **Full guest bath:** $15,000 to $30,000
- **Master bathroom renovation:** $25,000 to $50,000+

The difference between the low end and the high end mostly comes down to tile, fixtures, and whether you're moving plumbing.

### 2. Ignoring Ventilation
Florida is humid. Your bathroom is humid. Without proper ventilation, you're going to get mold. Every bathroom needs an exhaust fan rated for the room's square footage. This is not optional here the way it might be in a drier climate.

### 3. Prioritizing Looks Over Function
That freestanding soaking tub looks stunning in photos. But if you've got two kids under five who need baths every night, a built-in tub with a handheld showerhead is way more practical. Think about how you actually use the room before falling in love with a design.

### 4. Bad Lighting
Bathrooms need layers of light, not just one overhead fixture:
- **Task lighting** at the vanity. Sconces mounted at face height on either side of the mirror are the way to go, not a single light above.
- **Ambient lighting** for general brightness
- **Accent lighting** like an LED strip under a floating vanity or in a shower niche

### 5. Cutting Corners on Waterproofing
This is where cheap renovations come back to haunt you. In Florida's humidity, proper waterproofing behind shower tile and around tub surrounds is non-negotiable. We use systems like Schluter DITRA or RedGard membrane to make sure water stays where it belongs.

### 6. Forgetting About Storage
Floating vanities are trendy and they look clean. But if you don't plan additional storage, you're going to have stuff piled on every surface within a month. Think about medicine cabinets, linen closets or built-in shelving, and recessed shower niches.

### 7. Not Planning Electrical Outlets
You need GFCI-protected outlets near every water source. That's code. But beyond that, think about where you actually need power. Outlets inside vanity drawers for electric toothbrushes and hair tools are a small detail that makes a big difference.

### 8. Moving Plumbing for No Good Reason
Relocating a toilet or shower drain is expensive. If your current layout is functional, keep the plumbing where it is. Spend the money on better finishes instead. You'll get more impact for less cost.

### 9. Doing the Work Yourself When You Shouldn't
Painting? Go for it. Swapping a faucet? Probably fine. But plumbing rough-in, electrical work, and tile installation in a wet area? Hire a professional. A bad shower pan installation will cost you way more in water damage repairs than the labor you saved.

### 10. Skipping the Permit
Bathroom renovations that involve plumbing, electrical, or structural changes require [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) in every Central Florida county. An unpermitted renovation can cause problems when you sell the house and can void your insurance if something goes wrong.

J&N StructureWorks handles bathroom renovations the right way, with proper permits, licensed tradespeople, and attention to the details that matter. We've renovated bathrooms in homes from [Winter Garden](/ServiceAreaWinterGarden) to [Oviedo](/ServiceAreaOviedo), and we know what works in this climate.`

    content: `## Building in Osceola County

Osceola County is where a lot of the growth is happening in Central Florida right now. Land is more affordable than in Orange or Seminole, there's a ton of new development, and the infrastructure is catching up fast. It's a good place to build if you know what to expect going in.

### Why People Are Building Here

- **Land prices** are noticeably lower than Orange and Seminole counties. You can still find buildable lots under **$100,000** in some areas, which is getting harder to do closer to downtown Orlando.
- **New communities and infrastructure** are popping up constantly. Roads, schools, and commercial development are all expanding.
- **Location** is solid. You're close to [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando), the theme parks, the airport, and the [Lake Nona](/ServiceAreaLakeNona) medical corridor.
- **Newer neighborhoods** tend to have modern community planning with parks, trails, and better stormwater management.

### The Permit Process

Osceola County has actually improved its permitting process quite a bit over the past few years:

1. **Submit your plans** through the county's online portal
2. **Plan review** takes about **10 to 20 business days**, depending on their backlog
3. **Permit issuance** after all reviewer comments have been addressed and fees paid
4. **Inspections** need to be scheduled at least **24 hours** in advance through the county system

The building department is in [Kissimmee](/ServiceAreaKissimmee), and the staff has been pretty responsive in our experience. Just make sure your plans are complete before you submit. Incomplete applications get bounced back.

### Impact Fees (2025 Estimates)

This is the part that catches people off guard. Osceola County's impact fees are some of the highest in the region:

- Transportation: roughly **$7,800**
- Schools: roughly **$6,200**
- Parks: roughly **$1,400**
- Fire and EMS: roughly **$700**
- Law Enforcement: roughly **$500**
- Library: roughly **$300**
- **Total: approximately $16,900** for a single-family home

That's about **$4,000 more** than [Seminole County](/Blog/seminole-county-building-requirements) for the same type of home. Make sure these are in your budget from the start.

### Regulations to Know

- **Minimum home size** varies depending on the zoning and which development you're in. Some master-planned communities have their own minimums that are higher than the county's.
- **Stormwater management** requirements are strict, especially in newer developments. Your site plan needs to show how water runoff is being handled.
- **Environmental setbacks** apply along lakes and conservation areas. You can't build right up to the water.
- **HOA requirements** in master-planned communities like Tohoqua or Harmony may be stricter than county minimums. Review CC&Rs carefully.

### Where the Growth Is

- **Tohoqua area and the communities near Lake Nona** on the Orange/Osceola border. This corridor along Boggy Creek Road is booming.
- **St. Cloud** is growing steadily with new residential and commercial development along Narcoossee Road and east on US-192.
- **Poinciana** continues to expand. It's more affordable than other areas, though the commute into Orlando is longer.
- **Harmony and NeoCity** are planned communities with a tech-forward approach. NeoCity in particular is tied to the BRIDG semiconductor facility.

J&N StructureWorks has built throughout Osceola County and we're familiar with the local permitting offices, impact fee schedules, and community-specific requirements. We'll walk you through all of it.`

    content: `## Building a Home That Doesn't Cost a Fortune to Cool

Florida electricity bills are no joke. We've had clients move here from the Midwest and nearly fall over when they see their first July Duke Energy bill. The good news is that smart choices during construction can cut your monthly costs dramatically. And most of these upgrades pay for themselves within a few years.

### Start with the HVAC System

Your air conditioner is the single biggest energy consumer in a Florida home. It's running most of the year, so this is where efficiency matters most.

- Go with a **16+ SEER2 rated system** at minimum. Code requires 15 SEER2, but that extra step up is worth it.
- **Variable-speed compressors** adjust their output based on demand instead of cycling on and off constantly. They use less energy and do a much better job of controlling humidity.
- **Zoned systems** let you cool occupied rooms without wasting energy on empty guest bedrooms.
- Make sure the unit is properly sized. An oversized AC cycles too frequently and doesn't dehumidify well. Your house might be cool but it'll feel clammy.

### Insulation Makes More Difference Than People Think

Florida code minimums for insulation are just that. Minimums. You can do better.

- **Attic insulation:** Code is R-38. We recommend **R-49** for Central Florida. Heat radiates down through the roof, and that extra insulation makes a noticeable difference in your cooling bill.
- **Wall insulation:** Blown-in cellulose or spray foam provides better air sealing than standard fiberglass batts. Spray foam is more expensive but it's a significant upgrade.
- **Radiant barriers** in the attic reflect heat back up instead of letting it radiate down into your living space. They can reduce cooling loads by **5 to 10%**.

### Windows and Doors

Your windows and doors are where you either keep the heat out or invite it in.

- **Low-E glass** reduces solar heat gain while still letting in natural light. It's standard on most [impact windows](/Blog/hurricane-resistant-home-construction).
- **Double-pane insulated glass** is the norm for new construction. Triple-pane is available if you want maximum efficiency, but the cost-to-benefit ratio gets diminishing.
- **Proper installation and sealing** around the frames eliminates air leaks. This is about the quality of the install as much as the product itself.

### Solar Power

Florida gets roughly **230 sunny days** per year. Putting solar panels on your roof makes a lot of financial sense.

- A typical **8 to 12 kW system** can offset most or all of your electric bill
- **Federal tax credits** cover **30%** of the installation cost through 2032
- **Net metering** through FPL and Duke Energy lets you sell excess power back to the grid
- If you're not ready for solar right now, at least have your builder run **solar-ready wiring** during construction. It costs almost nothing to add during the build and saves thousands later.

### Water Heating

Your water heater is the second or third biggest energy consumer in the house, depending on your habits.

- **Heat pump water heaters** are **2 to 3 times** more efficient than standard electric tank heaters. They pull heat from the surrounding air instead of generating it. In Florida's warm climate, they work exceptionally well.
- **Tankless water heaters** heat water on demand and never run out, but the upfront cost is higher.
- **Solar water heaters** work great in Florida. The payback period is shorter here than almost anywhere else in the country.

### Smart Home Features

- **Smart thermostats** like Ecobee or Nest learn your schedule and adjust cooling automatically. Simple to install, and the savings add up fast.
- **LED lighting throughout** uses **75%** less energy than incandescent bulbs. This should be standard in every new build.
- **Smart irrigation controllers** that adjust watering based on weather data reduce water waste and keep your utility bill down.

### The Bottom Line on ROI

An energy-efficient home in Central Florida can save you **$150 to $300+ per month** compared to a home [built to bare minimums](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida). Over 10 years, that's **$18,000 to $36,000** in savings. Many of the upgrades pay for themselves in 3 to 5 years, and they increase your home's resale value too.

J&N StructureWorks builds energy efficiency into every [custom home](/CustomHomes). We'll walk you through the options and help you figure out where to put your dollars for the biggest return.`

    content: `## Fix-and-Flip Construction for Central Florida Investors

The [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) metro area is still one of the better markets for fix-and-flip investors in the Southeast. Population growth, strong rental demand, and a steady supply of older homes that need work all add up to opportunity. But flipping houses profitably requires knowing your numbers, picking the right projects, and working with a contractor who understands the investor timeline.

### Know Your Numbers Before You Buy

The classic formula still applies: your purchase price plus renovation costs plus holding costs should leave you with a profit margin of at least **15 to 20%** after the sale. In Central Florida right now, that means:

- **Purchase price** for a flip candidate in neighborhoods like Pine Hills, Azalea Park, Holden Heights, or parts of Kissimmee typically runs **$150,000 to $300,000**
- **Renovation budgets** range from **$30,000 to $80,000** for a typical 3-bedroom, 2-bath home depending on scope
- **Holding costs** including taxes, insurance, utilities, and financing run about **$2,000 to $4,000 per month**
- **After Repair Value (ARV)** needs to justify all of the above with room to spare

If the math doesn't work on paper, it won't work in real life. Period.

### What to Renovate for Maximum ROI

Not every upgrade is worth the money. Focus on the things buyers in your price range actually care about:

**High ROI upgrades:**
- [Kitchen updates](/Blog/kitchen-renovation-guide-central-florida) (new counters, cabinet refacing or replacement, modern backsplash, updated appliances)
- [Bathroom renovations](/Blog/bathroom-renovation-mistakes-to-avoid) (new vanities, tile, fixtures)
- Flooring replacement throughout. LVP is the flip investor's best friend. It's fast to install, looks great, and is waterproof.
- Fresh interior and exterior paint. This is the cheapest transformation you can make.
- Curb appeal improvements (landscaping, front door, pressure washing, new house numbers)

**Lower ROI upgrades (usually not worth it on a flip):**
- Pool installation. Costs **$40,000+** and doesn't add that much to the ARV in most neighborhoods.
- High-end luxury finishes in a mid-range neighborhood. Don't put $100-per-square-foot countertops in a house with a **$350,000** ceiling.
- Complete roof replacement if the existing roof still has life left. A roof inspection report showing 10+ years remaining is often good enough for buyers.

### Typical Flip Renovation Timelines

Time is money on a flip. Every extra week is another month of holding costs. A well-run renovation should take:

- **Cosmetic flip** (paint, flooring, fixtures, minor kitchen and bath updates): **3 to 5 weeks**
- **Moderate renovation** (kitchen remodel, bath remodel, some layout changes, new flooring throughout): **6 to 10 weeks**
- **Major rehab** (structural work, roof, plumbing or electrical overhaul, full gut): **12 to 16+ weeks**

Permits are the wild card. If you're doing anything beyond cosmetic work in Orange or Osceola County, you're pulling [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida). Factor **2 to 4 weeks** of review time into your project schedule.

### Common Investor Mistakes

We work with a lot of investors, and these are the mistakes we see over and over:

- **Underestimating the scope.** You bought what you thought was a cosmetic flip, then discovered the plumbing is polybutylene and the electrical panel is a Federal Pacific. Budget extra for the unknowns.
- **Hiring the cheapest contractor.** Low bids often mean cut corners, missed inspections, or a crew that disappears halfway through. A reliable contractor who finishes on time saves you money even if their bid is a little higher.
- **Over-improving for the neighborhood.** Don't build a $500,000 house in a $350,000 neighborhood. Know your comps and renovate accordingly.
- **Skipping the inspection before purchasing.** Spend the **$400** on a thorough home inspection. It will save you from buying someone else's money pit.
- **Not having a contractor lined up before closing.** The day you close is the day renovations should start. Don't waste weeks finding a crew after you already own the property.

### Working With the Right Contractor

Flip investors need a contractor who works differently than someone building a custom home. You need fast turnarounds, transparent pricing, and a crew that shows up every day. At J&N StructureWorks, we work with investors across the Orlando metro and understand that every week on the timeline matters to your bottom line.`

    date: "2025-08-15",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `## Finding a Contractor You Can Actually Trust

Picking the wrong contractor is one of the most expensive mistakes you can make. We hear horror stories all the time from homeowners who hired someone based on a low bid or a smooth sales pitch and ended up with half-finished work, blown budgets, and a guy who stopped returning calls. It doesn't have to go that way. You just need to know what to look for and what to run from.

### Step 1: Verify Their License

This is not optional. In Florida, general contractors must hold a state license issued by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). You can look up any contractor at **myfloridalicense.com** in about 30 seconds.

What you're checking:
- The license is **active**, not expired, suspended, or revoked
- The license type matches the work they're proposing (a residential contractor license for home construction, a building contractor license for larger projects)
- There are no disciplinary actions on file

If someone tells you they don't need a license for the work they're doing, that's almost always wrong. Walk away.

### Step 2: Confirm Insurance

Ask to see a current Certificate of Insurance. You need to see two things:

- **General liability insurance** with at least **$1,000,000** in coverage. This protects you if something goes wrong during construction, like property damage or an injury on your land.
- **Workers' compensation insurance** that covers their crew. If a worker gets hurt on your job site and the contractor doesn't carry workers' comp, you could be on the hook.

Call the insurance company listed on the certificate to verify it's current. Certificates can be forged or outdated.

### Step 3: Get Multiple Bids (But Don't Just Pick the Cheapest)

Get at least **3 bids** for your project. When you compare them:

- Make sure everyone is bidding on the same scope of work. An apples-to-oranges comparison is useless.
- The lowest bid isn't always the best. If one contractor is **30% below** the others, ask yourself why. They might be cutting corners, using cheaper materials, or planning to hit you with change orders later.
- Look for itemized bids that break down costs by category (demolition, framing, plumbing, electrical, finishes, etc.). A one-line bid that just says "Kitchen remodel - $45,000" doesn't tell you anything.

### Step 4: Check References and Past Work

Ask for **3 to 5 references** from recent projects similar to yours. When you call them, ask:

- Did the project come in on budget?
- Did it finish on time?
- How was communication throughout the project?
- Were there any issues, and how were they handled?
- Would you hire them again?

Also look at online reviews, but take them with a grain of salt. A few negative reviews out of dozens might just be noise. A pattern of complaints about the same issue (no-shows, cost overruns, sloppy work) is a red flag.

### Step 5: Read the Contract Before You Sign

A good contract protects both sides. Make sure it includes:

- Detailed scope of work
- Total price with a payment schedule tied to milestones (not a big lump sum upfront)
- Start date and estimated completion date
- Allowances for materials you haven't selected yet
- How change orders are handled and priced
- Warranty information
- [Permit](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) responsibilities (the contractor should be pulling permits, not you)

Never pay more than **10 to 15%** upfront as a deposit. Florida law limits contractor deposits to **10%** of the contract price or **$1,000**, whichever is less, unless the contractor has a surety bond.

### Red Flags That Should Send You Running

- They want a big cash payment upfront and don't want to put anything in writing
- They can't provide a license number or insurance certificate
- They pressure you to start immediately without a signed contract
- They show up in an unmarked truck with no company info
- The bid is dramatically lower than everyone else's
- They suggest skipping permits to save time and money
- They have no physical business address, just a phone number
- They refuse to provide references

### The Contractor Relationship

Building or [renovating a home](/WholeHomeRenovations) is a partnership that lasts months. You want someone who communicates well, shows up when they say they will, and treats your project like it matters. At [J&N StructureWorks](/Contact), we're happy to provide our license, insurance, references, and detailed bids to anyone considering working with us. That's how it should work.`

    content: `## ADUs Are Having a Moment in Florida

Accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, have been around for a long time. But recent changes to Florida law have made them a much more realistic option for homeowners across the state. Whether you want to build a guest house for aging parents, create a rental unit for extra income, or just add a detached home office, ADUs are worth a serious look.

### What Counts as an ADU?

An ADU is a secondary dwelling unit on a single-family residential lot. It can be:

- A **detached structure** (standalone guest house or cottage)
- An **attached [addition](/RoomAdditions)** to the main house with its own entrance
- A **garage conversion** turned into a living space
- A **converted space** above an existing garage

To qualify as a true ADU, it needs its own kitchen, bathroom, sleeping area, and separate entrance. It's basically a small, independent home on the same lot as your primary residence.

### Florida's New ADU Laws

Florida passed legislation (SB 102, effective July 2023) that preempts local governments from outright banning ADUs on single-family residential lots. That's a big deal because many cities and counties previously made it nearly impossible to build one.

What the law does:
- Requires local governments to allow ADUs on lots zoned for single-family residential use
- Prohibits local governments from requiring the owner to live in either the primary home or the ADU (this was a big barrier before)
- Allows ADUs to be used as rental units
- Still allows local governments to set reasonable standards for size, setbacks, parking, and design

What the law doesn't do:
- It doesn't override HOA restrictions. If your HOA covenants prohibit ADUs or accessory structures, the state law doesn't help you.
- It doesn't waive permitting requirements. You still need to go through the full permit process.

### What It Costs to Build an ADU in Central Florida

ADU costs depend heavily on size, finishes, and whether you're building from scratch or converting existing space.

- **Garage conversion:** $30,000 to $60,000. You're working with an existing structure, so costs are lower. Adding plumbing for a kitchen and bath is the biggest expense.
- **Detached ADU (400 to 600 sq ft):** $80,000 to $150,000. This is a ground-up build with its own foundation, utilities, and everything.
- **Detached ADU (600 to 1,000 sq ft):** $120,000 to $200,000+. A larger unit with a full kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and living area.
- **Above-garage unit:** $60,000 to $120,000. The structure already exists, but you're adding living space with plumbing, electrical, and HVAC.

### The Permitting Process

Building an ADU in [Orange County](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida), [Seminole County](/Blog/seminole-county-building-requirements), or anywhere else in Central Florida requires permits. The process looks similar to any new construction:

1. **Check local zoning** to confirm ADU eligibility on your lot and learn about size and setback restrictions
2. **Hire an architect or designer** to draw up plans that meet the Florida Building Code
3. **Submit plans** to the county building department for review
4. **Address reviewer comments** and get approval
5. **Pull your permits** and begin construction
6. **Schedule inspections** at each phase, just like a regular build
7. **Receive your Certificate of Occupancy** when the unit is complete

Plan for **4 to 8 weeks** for the permitting phase, depending on the county.

### Design Considerations

A few things to think about as you plan:

- **Parking.** Some municipalities require an additional parking space for the ADU. Check your local requirements.
- **Utility connections.** You can tap into the main house's utilities or run separate meters. Separate meters make it easier if you're renting the unit out.
- **Privacy.** Placement on the lot matters. You want both the main house and the ADU to feel like they have their own space.
- **Style.** Most local regulations require the ADU to be architecturally consistent with the main house. It doesn't have to match exactly, but it shouldn't look out of place.

### Rental Income Potential

An ADU in the [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) metro area can bring in real money:

- A well-finished **1-bed, 1-bath ADU** in a decent location can rent for **$1,200 to $1,800 per month** on a standard lease
- Short-term rental income through platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo can be higher, but check local short-term rental regulations first. Orange County and several municipalities have specific rules about this.
- Even at **$1,400 per month** in rent, you're looking at **$16,800 per year** in income. That's a solid return on your investment.

Lake County is becoming one of the most popular places to build in the greater Orlando area, and it's easy to see why. You get more land for your money, the commute into Orlando has gotten easier with the 429 extension and widening of US-27, and the rolling hills and lakes give it a different feel from the flat suburban sprawl further east. But Lake County has its own set of rules, fees, and quirks that are worth understanding before you commit.

### Why Lake County?

- **More affordable land** compared to Orange County. Lots in the [Clermont](/ServiceAreaClermont) and Groveland corridor that would cost twice as much in Horizon West or [Winter Garden](/ServiceAreaWinterGarden) are still available at reasonable prices.
- **Larger lot sizes** in many areas. If you want a half-acre or more, Lake County is where you'll find it without paying a premium.
- **Growing infrastructure.** New schools, commercial development, and road improvements are happening steadily, especially along the US-27 and SR-50 corridors.
- **Scenic beauty.** The chain of lakes, rolling terrain, and preservation areas give Lake County a character you don't get in the flatter parts of Central Florida.

### The Permit Process

Lake County's building department operates out of Tavares. The process follows the same general structure as other Central Florida counties:

1. **Submit your plans** including architectural, structural, and site plans. Lake County has an online portal for submissions.
2. **Plan review** typically takes **10 to 20 business days** for residential construction.
3. **Address any comments** from reviewers and resubmit if needed.
4. **Pay fees and receive your permit.**
5. **Schedule inspections** at each construction milestone. The county requires **24-hour advance notice** for inspection scheduling.

Lake County has been investing in their building department staff, and turnaround times have improved. That said, during busy periods you might wait a bit longer for reviews.

### Impact Fees (2025 Estimates)

Lake County's impact fees for a single-family home:

- Transportation: roughly **$4,900**
- Schools: roughly **$4,100**
- Parks and Recreation: roughly **$800**
- Fire and EMS: roughly **$500**
- Law Enforcement: roughly **$350**
- Library: roughly **$200**
- **Total: approximately $10,850**

That's lower than both Orange County (roughly **$14,000+**) and [Osceola County](/Blog/osceola-county-new-construction-guide) (roughly **$16,900**). The impact fee savings alone can offset some of the slightly longer commute for people who work in Orlando.

### Growth Areas to Watch

#### Clermont
Clermont is the biggest growth story in Lake County. The population has exploded over the past decade, and it's still going. Neighborhoods along Hartwood Marsh Road, the Wellness Way corridor south of town, and the areas between Clermont and Groveland are where a lot of new construction is happening. Great schools, retail, and easy access to the 429 make this a popular choice for families.

#### Mount Dora
Mount Dora has a completely different vibe. It's a charming small town with a historic downtown, and it attracts people who want something quieter. There's new construction happening on the outskirts, particularly south of town along US-441 and in new developments off Round Lake Road. Land prices are a bit higher here because of the demand, but you're paying for the character of the area.

#### Tavares and Eustis
These towns along the shores of Lake Dora and Lake Eustis are growing more quietly but steadily. Land is affordable, and you can still find lakefront or lake-adjacent lots at reasonable prices. The downtown areas are revitalizing with new restaurants and shops. If you don't need to be close to Orlando every day, these are worth considering.

#### Groveland and Mascotte
South Lake County along US-27. This is where you'll find the most affordable land in the county right now. Groveland in particular is seeing rapid residential development. The tradeoff is that it's further from the Orlando core and the commercial development hasn't fully caught up yet, but it's coming.

### How Lake County Differs from Orange and Seminole

A few things stand out when you compare:

- **Lower impact fees** save you money upfront. That $4,000 to $6,000 difference adds up.
- **Larger lots are easier to find.** In Orange County, especially in Horizon West, you're often looking at lots under a quarter acre. In Lake County, half-acre and one-acre lots are common in many areas.
- **Well and septic** are more common in unincorporated Lake County, especially in rural areas. Municipal water and sewer are available in Clermont, Mount Dora, and Tavares, but outside city limits, plan on a well and septic system, which adds **$15,000 to $25,000** to your build cost.
- **Tree and environmental regulations** are present but generally less restrictive than Seminole County's Wekiva Protection Area rules.
- **HOA-free living** is still possible. Many Lake County lots outside master-planned communities don't have HOA restrictions, which gives you more freedom on your design.

### A Couple Things to Watch Out For

- **Commute times.** If you work in downtown Orlando, you're looking at 45 to 60+ minutes depending on where in Lake County you build. The 429 toll road helps, but it costs money every day.
- **Elevation changes.** Lake County has hills. That's part of the appeal, but it also means some lots need more site work and retaining walls. Get a survey and soil test before you buy.
- **Rural lot infrastructure.** Some cheaper lots outside the growth corridors might not have paved road access, nearby electrical service, or internet options beyond satellite. Drive out and look before you buy.
