    content: `## What New Builds Actually Cost in Central Florida

We get this question more than any other. People want a number, and the honest answer is that it depends. But we can give you real ranges based on what we're seeing on the ground across Orange, Seminole, Osceola, and Lake counties right now.

### Cost Per Square Foot in 2025

Right now, you're looking at somewhere between **$150 and $250+ per square foot** for a new build in the Central Florida area. That range is wide because finishes, lot conditions, and which county you're in make a big difference. Here's how it breaks down:

- **Budget-conscious builds:** $150 to $180/sq ft. You're getting a solid home with builder-grade finishes. Nothing wrong with that.
- **Mid-range [custom homes](/CustomHomes):** $180 to $220/sq ft. Upgraded cabinets, quartz counters, better tile. This is where most of our clients land.
- **High-end custom builds:** $220 to $300+/sq ft. We're talking custom everything, premium materials, smart home systems, the works.

### What's Actually in That Number?

A full construction budget covers more than just walls and a roof:

1. **Site Work and Foundation** - Clearing the lot, grading, hauling in fill dirt, and pouring the concrete slab
2. **Framing and Roofing** - Structural lumber, trusses, sheathing, and your roofing material
3. **Mechanical Systems** - Plumbing lines, electrical wiring, and HVAC equipment
4. **Interior Finishes** - Drywall, flooring, cabinetry, countertops, and paint
5. **Exterior Finishes** - Stucco, siding, windows, and doors
6. **[Permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) and Impact Fees** - These vary a lot depending on the county, and they add up fast

### Costs That Sneak Up on You

First-time builders almost always get surprised by a few line items that aren't in the base quote:

- **Impact fees** can run anywhere from **$5,000 to $20,000+** depending on whether you're in Orange County, Osceola, or elsewhere
- **Utility connections** for water, sewer, and electric can tack on **$3,000 to $15,000**. If you're on a rural lot off Avalon Road or out past Christmas, it could be even more.
- **Soil testing and surveying** usually costs **$2,000 to $5,000**
- **Landscaping and the driveway** are almost never included in builder quotes. Budget separately for those.

### Keeping Your Build on Budget

- Get a detailed, itemized estimate. If someone just gives you a per-square-foot price and won't break it down, that's a problem.
- Set aside **10 to 15%** as a contingency fund. Things come up. They always do.
- Pick your lot carefully. A lot with bad soil or a high water table on the east side of Orange County is going to cost more to build on than a clean lot in [Clermont](/ServiceAreaClermont).
- Lock in material prices early when you can. Lumber and concrete prices still fluctuate.

At J&N StructureWorks, we give you a transparent, itemized estimate before we ever break ground. No guesswork, no ugly surprises at the end.`

    content: `## Finding a Lot That Won't Wreck Your Budget

The lot you pick will affect every part of your [custom home](/CustomHomes) build. A bad lot can add **$20,000 or more** in unexpected costs before you even pour a foundation. We've seen it happen too many times, so we always tell people to slow down at this stage.

### What to Look at Before You Buy

#### 1. Zoning and Land Use
Call the county planning department before you get emotionally attached to a piece of land. You need to confirm:
- The property is actually zoned for residential construction
- Minimum lot size requirements for building
- Setback requirements, which tell you how close to the property lines you can build
- Height restrictions and any deed restrictions or HOA rules that could limit your plans

If you're looking at a lot in unincorporated Seminole County versus a lot inside the City of [Sanford](/ServiceAreaSanford), the rules could be completely different. Always check.

#### 2. Soil Conditions
Florida soil is unpredictable. Two lots across the street from each other can have totally different conditions. A **geotechnical soil test** (usually $1,500 to $3,000) tells you:
- Whether the soil can actually support a slab foundation
- How deep the water table sits
- If you'll need extra fill dirt or some kind of soil stabilization work

Out near Narcoossee Road and down through St. Cloud, we've run into some really tricky soil conditions. Don't skip this step.

#### 3. Flood Zone Status
Pull up the FEMA flood maps for any lot you're considering. If you're in a flood zone, that means:
- Your insurance premiums go way up
- You'll likely need an elevated foundation
- Additional engineering costs get added to the build

Areas along the Little Econlockhatchee River, the St. Johns River corridor, and parts of [Kissimmee](/ServiceAreaKissimmee) can be flood-prone. Check before you commit.

#### 4. Utility Access
Make sure you know what's available at the lot:
- **Municipal water and sewer** or will you need a well and septic system? Septic adds cost and limits where you can build on the lot.
- **Electric service** and how far away the nearest transformer is. FPL or Duke Energy will charge you for running lines if the distance is far enough.
- **Internet and cable** matter more than people think, especially if you work from home. Rural lots west of Apopka or south of Poinciana can have limited options.

#### 5. Tree and Environmental Surveys
Most Central Florida counties require tree surveys before you can clear a lot. If you've got a mature live oak on the property, you might need a permit and possibly mitigation to remove it. Some trees can't be removed at all.

### Red Flags to Walk Away From

- A lot priced way below comparable parcels nearby. There's always a reason.
- Standing water on the lot after a rain. That's a drainage problem waiting to become your problem.
- Land adjacent to retention ponds or wetlands. Building setbacks from these can eat up a big chunk of your buildable area.
- Narrow or oddly shaped parcels that limit where the house can actually sit

### Bring Your Builder Along

We evaluate lots alongside our clients at J&N StructureWorks before they sign anything. We can spot issues that most buyers would miss and give you an honest cost estimate for what it'll take to build on that specific piece of land.`

    content: `## How the Orange County Permit Process Works

The permit process in Orange County isn't complicated, but it does take time. If you don't understand the steps, you're going to end up with delays that push your whole project back. We've pulled permits on dozens of builds in [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) and Orange County, so we know what to expect.

### Permits You'll Need for a New Home

For a standard [single-family build](/CustomHomes), you're filing for:

1. **Building Permit** - This is the big one covering all structural work
2. **Electrical Permit** - Covers wiring, panel installation, and all electrical systems
3. **Plumbing Permit** - Water supply and drainage
4. **Mechanical Permit** - HVAC ductwork and equipment
5. **Land Clearing Permit** - Required if you're removing trees or heavy vegetation from the lot

### Step by Step Through the Process

1. **Submit your plans** to the Orange County Building Division. You'll need architectural drawings, engineering plans, and a site plan. Everything goes through their online portal now.
2. **Plan review** takes about **2 to 4 weeks** for residential projects. Could be faster, could be slower depending on how backed up they are.
3. **Respond to comments** if the reviewer flags anything. They might ask for structural modifications or additional detail on your plans. Turn these around fast.
4. **Pick up your permit** once it's approved and post it where inspectors can see it at the job site.
5. **Schedule inspections** at each construction milestone. Don't get ahead of yourself. If you pour your slab before the foundation inspection, you've got a problem.

### Inspection Checkpoints

These are the stops along the way:

- Foundation and slab inspection
- Framing inspection
- Rough-in inspections for plumbing, electrical, and mechanical
- Insulation inspection
- Final inspection and your Certificate of Occupancy (CO)

Miss an inspection or fail one, and work stops until it's resolved. That's just how it goes.

### Impact Fees in Orange County

Orange County charges impact fees that fund roads, schools, parks, and other infrastructure. For a single-family home, budget for **$10,000 to $18,000** in total impact fees. The exact amount depends on the size and location of your home.

These are due at the time you pull your permit, so they need to be in your [budget from day one](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida).

### Getting Through It Smoothly

- Make sure your plans are complete and code-compliant before you submit. Incomplete submissions get kicked back, and you lose weeks.
- When comments come in, address them the same day if you can
- Never start work before the permit is issued. Orange County doesn't mess around with that.
- Keep every inspection record organized. You'll need them at closing and for your CO.

J&N StructureWorks handles the entire permitting process for our clients, from plan submission through the final Certificate of Occupancy. We deal with the county so you don't have to.`

    content: `## A Realistic Look at Your Build Timeline

Most [custom homes](/CustomHomes) in Central Florida take **8 to 14 months** from contract to move-in. Some people hear that and think it sounds long. Others think it sounds short. Either way, knowing what happens at each stage helps you plan your life around the build.

### Phase 1: Pre-Construction (4 to 8 Weeks)
This is the paperwork and planning phase. It doesn't feel like much is happening, but this is where the foundation for a smooth build gets laid.
- Finalize your floor plans and specifications
- Complete engineering and site plans
- Submit for [building permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) (expect the county to take 2 to 4 weeks)
- Order any long-lead materials like custom windows, specialty trusses, or specific tile

### Phase 2: Site Work and Foundation (2 to 3 Weeks)
Now you'll actually see dirt moving. This is when it gets real.
- Clear and grade the lot
- Install underground plumbing and utility connections
- Pour the concrete slab foundation
- **Inspection milestone:** Foundation and slab

### Phase 3: Framing (3 to 4 Weeks)
The house starts to take shape. This is the part where clients get excited because you can finally walk through the rooms.
- Put up walls, set roof trusses, and install sheathing
- Hang windows and exterior doors
- Apply roof underlayment and roofing material
- **Inspection milestone:** Framing

### Phase 4: Rough-Ins (3 to 4 Weeks)
The guts of the house go in. Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC all happen during this phase.
- Install plumbing supply and drain lines
- Run electrical wiring and set the panel
- Install HVAC ductwork and the air handler
- **Inspection milestones:** Plumbing, electrical, and mechanical rough-ins

### Phase 5: Insulation and Drywall (2 to 3 Weeks)
- Install insulation in the walls and attic
- Hang drywall, tape the seams, and finish it smooth
- **Inspection milestone:** Insulation (happens before drywall goes up)

### Phase 6: Interior Finishes (4 to 6 Weeks)
This is the longest finish phase, and it's where your house starts to feel like a home.
- Cabinetry and countertop installation
- Flooring goes down (tile, LVP, hardwood, whatever you picked)
- Interior paint on walls and trim
- Light fixtures, hardware, and appliances get installed

### Phase 7: Exterior Finishes (2 to 3 Weeks)
- Stucco or siding application
- Gutters and downspouts
- Driveway and walkways get poured
- Landscaping and irrigation system installation

### Phase 8: Final Inspections and Close-Out (1 to 2 Weeks)
The finish line. Almost there.
- Final building inspection by the county
- Certificate of Occupancy gets issued
- Final walkthrough with you, the homeowner
- Punch list items get knocked out (small touch-ups, adjustments, etc.)

### What Causes Delays

Be realistic about these. They happen on almost every build:

- **Weather.** Florida's rainy season runs June through September, and afternoon thunderstorms can shut down exterior work for days at a time.
- **Permit review times.** Counties get backed up, especially during building booms. There's not much you can do but wait.
- **Material delays.** Custom windows, imported tile, and specialty items can take weeks. Order early.
- **Change orders.** Every time you change your mind during construction, it [costs time and money](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida). Make your decisions during pre-construction and stick with them.

J&N StructureWorks keeps clients updated at every phase. You'll always know where your build stands and what's coming next.`

    content: `## Open Concept or Defined Rooms? It Depends on How You Live.

This comes up in almost every design meeting. Clients come in knowing they want an open floor plan because that's what they've seen on HGTV for the last decade. And look, open plans are great. But they're not perfect for everyone, and there are good reasons to consider other options too.

### Open Floor Plans

**What works well:**
- The space feels bigger and airier, even in a smaller home
- Great for families who like to hang out together. You can cook while the kids are doing homework in the living room.
- Natural light flows through the whole area instead of getting trapped in one room
- Entertaining is easier when your kitchen, dining, and living areas are all connected

**What doesn't work as well:**
- Zero privacy. If someone's watching TV and someone else needs quiet, tough luck.
- Cooking smells fill the entire living space. Fish tacos on a Tuesday night? Everyone knows.
- Everything is always on display. There's no closing a door to hide the mess.
- You need to be more intentional with furniture placement to define the different zones

### Traditional Layouts with Defined Rooms

**What works well:**
- Better noise control between spaces
- Each room has a clear purpose
- Easier to heat and cool individual rooms efficiently
- More wall space for built-in storage, bookshelves, and artwork

**What doesn't work as well:**
- Can feel smaller and darker, even in a bigger house
- Interior rooms don't get much natural light
- You can't keep an eye on kids in the living room while you're in the kitchen

### Why Open Plans Make Extra Sense in Florida

Central Florida living is all about the indoors flowing into the outdoors. An open great room with **large sliding glass doors** that open to a covered lanai and pool is the dream setup. Florida's sunshine floods that kind of space beautifully.

If you're building in a community like [Lake Nona](/ServiceAreaLakeNona), Horizon West, or out in [Clermont](/ServiceAreaClermont) where lots tend to be bigger, an open plan with a big lanai is almost the default because it just fits the lifestyle.

### Most People End Up Going Hybrid

Honestly, the majority of our [custom home](/CustomHomes) clients at J&N StructureWorks do a mix. Open kitchen, living, and dining area. Then separate bedrooms, a dedicated home office, and maybe a bonus room with a door for the kids. You get the social space and the private space without compromising on either.

The right layout is the one that matches how your family actually spends their time at home, not what looks best in a magazine.`

    content: `## What a Kitchen Renovation Actually Looks Like

[Kitchens](/KitchenBathRemodeling) are the most popular renovation we do, and for good reason. A well-done kitchen upgrade makes your house more enjoyable to live in every single day. It also tends to return **60 to 80%** of its cost at resale, which makes it one of the smarter home improvement investments out there.

### What Kitchens Cost in Central Florida

Prices depend heavily on the scope. A cosmetic refresh and a full gut-job are two very different animals.

- **Cosmetic refresh:** $15,000 to $30,000. New cabinet faces, counters, backsplash, and maybe updated fixtures. You're keeping the existing layout.
- **Mid-range remodel:** $30,000 to $60,000. New cabinets, new countertops, updated flooring, new appliances, and some layout changes.
- **Full renovation:** $60,000 to $100,000+. Walls coming down, plumbing and electrical getting moved, custom cabinetry, premium everything.

### Where the Money Goes

1. **Cabinetry** eats up the biggest chunk, usually **30 to 40%** of the total budget. Semi-custom vs. fully custom makes a huge difference in price.
2. **Countertops** vary wildly. Quartz runs about **$50 to $100** per square foot installed. Marble and exotic granite push past **$150**.
3. **Appliances** for a full suite (fridge, range, dishwasher, microwave, hood) typically cost **$5,000 to $15,000** depending on brands.
4. **Flooring** is usually tile or luxury vinyl plank in Central Florida kitchens. Both hold up well to moisture and heavy foot traffic.
5. **Plumbing and electrical work** can blow up a budget fast if you're moving the sink, adding an island with a cooktop, or relocating outlets.

### What's Trending in 2025

- White or light-colored cabinets paired with warm wood accent pieces
- Large-format porcelain tile backsplashes, sometimes running all the way to the ceiling
- Waterfall-edge countertops on kitchen islands
- Integrated smart appliances with Wi-Fi connectivity
- Pot fillers above the range and touchless faucets at the sink

### How Long It Takes

Plan on **6 to 10 weeks** from demo day to the final walkthrough:
- Week 1: Demolition and any rough-in work
- Weeks 2 to 3: Electrical updates, plumbing changes, and drywall patching
- Weeks 4 to 5: Cabinet installation
- Weeks 6 to 7: Countertop templating, fabrication, and installation
- Weeks 8 to 10: Backsplash, fixtures, appliance install, and final touch-ups

Countertop fabrication is the usual bottleneck. Templates can't happen until cabinets are in, and fabrication takes 1 to 2 weeks after that.

### Making It Go Smoothly

- Set up a temporary kitchen somewhere else in the house. A folding table, a microwave, and a coffee maker in the garage goes a long way.
- Make every single material selection before demolition starts. Changing your mind on cabinet color in week 3 will push your timeline back by weeks.
- Budget **15%** above your base estimate for contingencies. Older homes in places like [Winter Park](/ServiceAreaWinterPark), College Park, and Maitland almost always have surprises behind the walls.
- Make sure your contractor is licensed and pulling [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida). Kitchen renovations in Florida require them.

    content: `## What You Should Know About Building in Seminole County

Seminole County does things a little differently from Orange and Osceola. The county is more built-out, the lots tend to be smaller, and the regulations are tighter in some areas. That doesn't mean it's harder to build here. You just need to know what you're working with.

### The Permit Process

Seminole County runs everything through an electronic plan review system, which actually makes things move a bit faster than some neighboring counties.

1. **Pre-application meeting** - Not required, but it's a good idea if your project has any unusual features or if the lot has quirks
2. **Submit plans electronically** through the county's online portal
3. **Plan review** takes about **10 to 15 business days** for residential projects
4. **Permit issuance** once your plans are approved and fees are paid
5. **Inspections** get scheduled through the county system. You can do it online.

The building department office is off Bush Boulevard in [Sanford](/ServiceAreaSanford) if you ever need to go in person, but most of it can be handled online.

### Regulations Worth Knowing

- **Setbacks** vary by zoning district. A lot in Longwood might have totally different setback requirements than one in [Oviedo](/ServiceAreaOviedo). Check your specific property's zoning.
- **Maximum lot coverage** is typically **35 to 45%** for residential zones. That limits how big you can build relative to the lot.
- **Hurricane protection** applies to all new construction. Everything has to meet Florida Building Code wind load requirements.
- **Tree protection** is strict in Seminole County. They don't take kindly to clearing a lot without proper permits and tree surveys.

### Impact Fees (2025 Estimates)

These are approximate for a single-family home:
- Transportation: roughly **$5,500**
- Schools: roughly **$4,800**
- Parks and Recreation: roughly **$1,200**
- Fire: roughly **$600**
- Law Enforcement: roughly **$400**
- **Total: approximately $12,500**

That's on the lower end compared to Osceola County, which is one reason some people look at Seminole County even though the land costs more.

### Things That Make Seminole County Unique

- A lot of Seminole County falls inside the **Wekiva Protection Area**. If your lot is in or near it (think areas around Wekiva Springs Road, Longwood, and parts of Sanford), you'll deal with additional environmental regulations around stormwater, septic, and clearing.
- **Septic systems** are still required in some unincorporated pockets without municipal sewer. The county health department handles those permits separately.
- Properties along the **St. Johns River corridor** have strict flood zone requirements. If you're looking at land near Geneva or along the river east of Sanford, get a flood determination early.

J&N StructureWorks has built extensively throughout Seminole County, from Winter Springs to [Lake Mary](/ServiceAreaLakeMary) to Oviedo. We know the local requirements and handle all the permitting, inspections, and regulatory work so you can focus on the fun part of designing your home.`

    content: `## Why Florida Homes Are Built Different

If you've moved here from somewhere up north, you probably noticed that construction looks different in Florida. There's a reason for that. The Florida Building Code is one of the strictest in the country when it comes to wind resistance, and every choice, from the concrete blocks to the roof straps, is designed to keep your house standing in a hurricane.

### What the Florida Building Code Requires

Every [new home](/CustomHomes) in Florida has to meet the FBC, and that includes some serious structural requirements:

- **Wind speed design** means your home must withstand sustained winds based on your specific location. In Central Florida, that's typically **130 to 150 mph**.
- **Impact protection** on all windows and doors. They need to be impact-rated or you need approved hurricane shutters. There's no middle ground.
- **Roof-to-wall connections** with hurricane straps or clips at every single truss-to-wall connection point.
- **Continuous load path** from roof to foundation. The whole structure needs to be tied together so wind forces transfer all the way down into the ground.

### The Features That Actually Matter

#### Impact-Rated Windows and Doors
These are the single best upgrade you can make. Impact windows:
- Stop wind-borne debris from penetrating the building envelope
- Provide excellent noise reduction (you'll notice this day to day, not just during storms)
- Block UV rays that fade furniture and flooring
- Eliminate the scramble to put up plywood or shutters when a storm is coming

They cost more upfront, but they pay for themselves in insurance savings and peace of mind.

#### Concrete Block Construction (CBS)
Most [Central Florida](/Services) homes are built with **CMU (concrete masonry unit)** walls. The blocks get reinforced with steel rebar and filled with concrete. It's a completely different animal from wood-frame construction when it comes to wind resistance. This is standard here and it's one of the reasons Florida homes hold up as well as they do.

#### Hip Roofs Over Gable Roofs
A hip roof slopes on all four sides. A gable roof has two flat ends that catch wind like a sail. In high winds, hip roofs perform significantly better because their shape reduces uplift forces. If you have the choice, go with a hip roof.

#### Engineered Roof Trusses
Modern trusses are designed by engineers using software that calculates exact wind loads for your location. Each one gets connected to the wall below with galvanized hurricane straps. Nothing is left to guesswork.

### Going Beyond the Minimum

At J&N StructureWorks, we usually recommend exceeding code minimums in a few key areas:

- **Heavy-duty hurricane straps** at every connection, not just the standard ones
- **Impact-rated garage doors**, because the garage opening is the most vulnerable spot on most homes. If that door fails, wind pressure can blow the roof off.
- **Secondary water barriers** under the roofing material as an extra layer of leak protection
- **Reinforced entry doors** with multi-point locking systems

### How This Saves You Money

Building above code can cut your homeowner's insurance premiums significantly. Many Florida insurers offer **wind mitigation discounts of 20 to 40%** when you can document specific hurricane-resistant features. Over the life of the home, those savings add up to tens of thousands of dollars.

Good construction isn't just about surviving a storm. It's about building something that protects your family and [saves you money](/Blog/energy-efficient-home-features) for decades.`

    content: `## Picking Flooring That Can Handle Florida

Flooring in Florida takes a beating. Between the humidity, the afternoon rainstorms that blow in through the lanai, and the sand that gets tracked in constantly, you need something that can hold up. Not every flooring material is cut out for it.

### Porcelain and Ceramic Tile

**Works best in:** [Bathrooms, kitchens](/KitchenBathRemodeling), entryways, and Florida rooms

Tile is a workhorse. It's extremely durable, completely water-resistant, and available in more styles than you could look through in a month. Wood-look porcelain planks are hugely popular right now, and some of them are hard to tell from real wood unless you touch them.

The one downside is that tile can feel cold underfoot during those few weeks of Florida "winter." Some people add area rugs. Others don't mind.

- **Cost:** $3 to $15 per square foot installed

### Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)

**Works best in:** Main living areas, bedrooms, and whole-house installations

LVP has taken over the Central Florida market and it's easy to see why. It's **100% waterproof**, warm and comfortable to walk on, and the better brands genuinely look like real hardwood. If you've got kids and dogs, this is probably your best option.

Installation is faster than tile, and if a plank gets damaged down the road, replacing a section is straightforward.

- **Cost:** $4 to $10 per square foot installed

### Engineered Hardwood

**Works best in:** Living rooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms

If you want real wood, go engineered rather than solid hardwood in Florida. The layered construction handles humidity swings much better. You can refinish most engineered hardwood once or twice depending on the veneer thickness.

Keep it out of bathrooms and laundry rooms though. Moisture is still its weakness.

- **Cost:** $6 to $15 per square foot installed

### Polished Concrete

**Works best in:** Modern, contemporary, and industrial-style homes

This one surprises people. Since Florida homes are built on concrete slabs, you've already got the floor. Polishing, staining, or scoring the existing slab gives you an incredibly durable, low-maintenance floor with a modern look.

We've done this in a few builds out in the [Lake Nona](/ServiceAreaLakeNona) and Horizon West areas, and clients love it.

- **Cost:** $3 to $8 per square foot to polish the existing slab

### What We Usually Recommend

For most of our [Central Florida builds](/CustomHomes), we suggest a combination approach:
- **LVP or large-format tile** throughout the main living areas and hallways
- **Porcelain tile** in all bathrooms and wet areas
- **Carpet** only in bedrooms, and only if you actually want it. A lot of our clients are skipping carpet entirely.

J&N StructureWorks helps clients pick flooring that fits their lifestyle, holds up to Florida's climate, and looks great. We'll walk you through samples and pricing so you can make a decision you won't regret.`

    content: `## Bathroom Renovations Gone Wrong (and How to Avoid It)

[Bathroom remodels](/KitchenBathRemodeling) can add real value to your home and make your morning routine about ten times better. But they can also go sideways fast if you don't plan carefully. We've cleaned up after enough botched bathroom jobs to know what goes wrong and why.

### 1. Underestimating the Budget
This is the number one mistake. People see a bathroom on Pinterest and assume they can get it for $10,000. In Central Florida, here's what you're actually looking at:
- **Half bath remodel:** $8,000 to $15,000
- **Full guest bath:** $15,000 to $30,000
- **Master bathroom renovation:** $25,000 to $50,000+

The difference between the low end and the high end mostly comes down to tile, fixtures, and whether you're moving plumbing.

### 2. Ignoring Ventilation
Florida is humid. Your bathroom is humid. Without proper ventilation, you're going to get mold. Every bathroom needs an exhaust fan rated for the room's square footage. This is not optional here the way it might be in a drier climate.

### 3. Prioritizing Looks Over Function
That freestanding soaking tub looks stunning in photos. But if you've got two kids under five who need baths every night, a built-in tub with a handheld showerhead is way more practical. Think about how you actually use the room before falling in love with a design.

### 4. Bad Lighting
Bathrooms need layers of light, not just one overhead fixture:
- **Task lighting** at the vanity. Sconces mounted at face height on either side of the mirror are the way to go, not a single light above.
- **Ambient lighting** for general brightness
- **Accent lighting** like an LED strip under a floating vanity or in a shower niche

### 5. Cutting Corners on Waterproofing
This is where cheap renovations come back to haunt you. In Florida's humidity, proper waterproofing behind shower tile and around tub surrounds is non-negotiable. We use systems like Schluter DITRA or RedGard membrane to make sure water stays where it belongs.

### 6. Forgetting About Storage
Floating vanities are trendy and they look clean. But if you don't plan additional storage, you're going to have stuff piled on every surface within a month. Think about medicine cabinets, linen closets or built-in shelving, and recessed shower niches.

### 7. Not Planning Electrical Outlets
You need GFCI-protected outlets near every water source. That's code. But beyond that, think about where you actually need power. Outlets inside vanity drawers for electric toothbrushes and hair tools are a small detail that makes a big difference.

### 8. Moving Plumbing for No Good Reason
Relocating a toilet or shower drain is expensive. If your current layout is functional, keep the plumbing where it is. Spend the money on better finishes instead. You'll get more impact for less cost.

### 9. Doing the Work Yourself When You Shouldn't
Painting? Go for it. Swapping a faucet? Probably fine. But plumbing rough-in, electrical work, and tile installation in a wet area? Hire a professional. A bad shower pan installation will cost you way more in water damage repairs than the labor you saved.

### 10. Skipping the Permit
Bathroom renovations that involve plumbing, electrical, or structural changes require [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) in every Central Florida county. An unpermitted renovation can cause problems when you sell the house and can void your insurance if something goes wrong.

J&N StructureWorks handles bathroom renovations the right way, with proper permits, licensed tradespeople, and attention to the details that matter. We've renovated bathrooms in homes from [Winter Garden](/ServiceAreaWinterGarden) to [Oviedo](/ServiceAreaOviedo), and we know what works in this climate.`

    content: `## Building in Osceola County

Osceola County is where a lot of the growth is happening in Central Florida right now. Land is more affordable than in Orange or Seminole, there's a ton of new development, and the infrastructure is catching up fast. It's a good place to build if you know what to expect going in.

### Why People Are Building Here

- **Land prices** are noticeably lower than Orange and Seminole counties. You can still find buildable lots under **$100,000** in some areas, which is getting harder to do closer to downtown Orlando.
- **New communities and infrastructure** are popping up constantly. Roads, schools, and commercial development are all expanding.
- **Location** is solid. You're close to [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando), the theme parks, the airport, and the [Lake Nona](/ServiceAreaLakeNona) medical corridor.
- **Newer neighborhoods** tend to have modern community planning with parks, trails, and better stormwater management.

### The Permit Process

Osceola County has actually improved its permitting process quite a bit over the past few years:

1. **Submit your plans** through the county's online portal
2. **Plan review** takes about **10 to 20 business days**, depending on their backlog
3. **Permit issuance** after all reviewer comments have been addressed and fees paid
4. **Inspections** need to be scheduled at least **24 hours** in advance through the county system

The building department is in [Kissimmee](/ServiceAreaKissimmee), and the staff has been pretty responsive in our experience. Just make sure your plans are complete before you submit. Incomplete applications get bounced back.

### Impact Fees (2025 Estimates)

This is the part that catches people off guard. Osceola County's impact fees are some of the highest in the region:

- Transportation: roughly **$7,800**
- Schools: roughly **$6,200**
- Parks: roughly **$1,400**
- Fire and EMS: roughly **$700**
- Law Enforcement: roughly **$500**
- Library: roughly **$300**
- **Total: approximately $16,900** for a single-family home

That's about **$4,000 more** than [Seminole County](/Blog/seminole-county-building-requirements) for the same type of home. Make sure these are in your budget from the start.

### Regulations to Know

- **Minimum home size** varies depending on the zoning and which development you're in. Some master-planned communities have their own minimums that are higher than the county's.
- **Stormwater management** requirements are strict, especially in newer developments. Your site plan needs to show how water runoff is being handled.
- **Environmental setbacks** apply along lakes and conservation areas. You can't build right up to the water.
- **HOA requirements** in master-planned communities like Tohoqua or Harmony may be stricter than county minimums. Review CC&Rs carefully.

### Where the Growth Is

- **Tohoqua area and the communities near Lake Nona** on the Orange/Osceola border. This corridor along Boggy Creek Road is booming.
- **St. Cloud** is growing steadily with new residential and commercial development along Narcoossee Road and east on US-192.
- **Poinciana** continues to expand. It's more affordable than other areas, though the commute into Orlando is longer.
- **Harmony and NeoCity** are planned communities with a tech-forward approach. NeoCity in particular is tied to the BRIDG semiconductor facility.

J&N StructureWorks has built throughout Osceola County and we're familiar with the local permitting offices, impact fee schedules, and community-specific requirements. We'll walk you through all of it.`

    content: `## Building a Home That Doesn't Cost a Fortune to Cool

Florida electricity bills are no joke. We've had clients move here from the Midwest and nearly fall over when they see their first July Duke Energy bill. The good news is that smart choices during construction can cut your monthly costs dramatically. And most of these upgrades pay for themselves within a few years.

### Start with the HVAC System

Your air conditioner is the single biggest energy consumer in a Florida home. It's running most of the year, so this is where efficiency matters most.

- Go with a **16+ SEER2 rated system** at minimum. Code requires 15 SEER2, but that extra step up is worth it.
- **Variable-speed compressors** adjust their output based on demand instead of cycling on and off constantly. They use less energy and do a much better job of controlling humidity.
- **Zoned systems** let you cool occupied rooms without wasting energy on empty guest bedrooms.
- Make sure the unit is properly sized. An oversized AC cycles too frequently and doesn't dehumidify well. Your house might be cool but it'll feel clammy.

### Insulation Makes More Difference Than People Think

Florida code minimums for insulation are just that. Minimums. You can do better.

- **Attic insulation:** Code is R-38. We recommend **R-49** for Central Florida. Heat radiates down through the roof, and that extra insulation makes a noticeable difference in your cooling bill.
- **Wall insulation:** Blown-in cellulose or spray foam provides better air sealing than standard fiberglass batts. Spray foam is more expensive but it's a significant upgrade.
- **Radiant barriers** in the attic reflect heat back up instead of letting it radiate down into your living space. They can reduce cooling loads by **5 to 10%**.

### Windows and Doors

Your windows and doors are where you either keep the heat out or invite it in.

- **Low-E glass** reduces solar heat gain while still letting in natural light. It's standard on most [impact windows](/Blog/hurricane-resistant-home-construction).
- **Double-pane insulated glass** is the norm for new construction. Triple-pane is available if you want maximum efficiency, but the cost-to-benefit ratio gets diminishing.
- **Proper installation and sealing** around the frames eliminates air leaks. This is about the quality of the install as much as the product itself.

### Solar Power

Florida gets roughly **230 sunny days** per year. Putting solar panels on your roof makes a lot of financial sense.

- A typical **8 to 12 kW system** can offset most or all of your electric bill
- **Federal tax credits** cover **30%** of the installation cost through 2032
- **Net metering** through FPL and Duke Energy lets you sell excess power back to the grid
- If you're not ready for solar right now, at least have your builder run **solar-ready wiring** during construction. It costs almost nothing to add during the build and saves thousands later.

### Water Heating

Your water heater is the second or third biggest energy consumer in the house, depending on your habits.

- **Heat pump water heaters** are **2 to 3 times** more efficient than standard electric tank heaters. They pull heat from the surrounding air instead of generating it. In Florida's warm climate, they work exceptionally well.
- **Tankless water heaters** heat water on demand and never run out, but the upfront cost is higher.
- **Solar water heaters** work great in Florida. The payback period is shorter here than almost anywhere else in the country.

### Smart Home Features

- **Smart thermostats** like Ecobee or Nest learn your schedule and adjust cooling automatically. Simple to install, and the savings add up fast.
- **LED lighting throughout** uses **75%** less energy than incandescent bulbs. This should be standard in every new build.
- **Smart irrigation controllers** that adjust watering based on weather data reduce water waste and keep your utility bill down.

### The Bottom Line on ROI

An energy-efficient home in Central Florida can save you **$150 to $300+ per month** compared to a home [built to bare minimums](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida). Over 10 years, that's **$18,000 to $36,000** in savings. Many of the upgrades pay for themselves in 3 to 5 years, and they increase your home's resale value too.

J&N StructureWorks builds energy efficiency into every [custom home](/CustomHomes). We'll walk you through the options and help you figure out where to put your dollars for the biggest return.`

    content: `## Fix-and-Flip Construction for Central Florida Investors

The [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) metro area is still one of the better markets for fix-and-flip investors in the Southeast. Population growth, strong rental demand, and a steady supply of older homes that need work all add up to opportunity. But flipping houses profitably requires knowing your numbers, picking the right projects, and working with a contractor who understands the investor timeline.

### Know Your Numbers Before You Buy

The classic formula still applies: your purchase price plus renovation costs plus holding costs should leave you with a profit margin of at least **15 to 20%** after the sale. In Central Florida right now, that means:

- **Purchase price** for a flip candidate in neighborhoods like Pine Hills, Azalea Park, Holden Heights, or parts of Kissimmee typically runs **$150,000 to $300,000**
- **Renovation budgets** range from **$30,000 to $80,000** for a typical 3-bedroom, 2-bath home depending on scope
- **Holding costs** including taxes, insurance, utilities, and financing run about **$2,000 to $4,000 per month**
- **After Repair Value (ARV)** needs to justify all of the above with room to spare

If the math doesn't work on paper, it won't work in real life. Period.

### What to Renovate for Maximum ROI

Not every upgrade is worth the money. Focus on the things buyers in your price range actually care about:

**High ROI upgrades:**
- [Kitchen updates](/Blog/kitchen-renovation-guide-central-florida) (new counters, cabinet refacing or replacement, modern backsplash, updated appliances)
- [Bathroom renovations](/Blog/bathroom-renovation-mistakes-to-avoid) (new vanities, tile, fixtures)
- Flooring replacement throughout. LVP is the flip investor's best friend. It's fast to install, looks great, and is waterproof.
- Fresh interior and exterior paint. This is the cheapest transformation you can make.
- Curb appeal improvements (landscaping, front door, pressure washing, new house numbers)

**Lower ROI upgrades (usually not worth it on a flip):**
- Pool installation. Costs **$40,000+** and doesn't add that much to the ARV in most neighborhoods.
- High-end luxury finishes in a mid-range neighborhood. Don't put $100-per-square-foot countertops in a house with a **$350,000** ceiling.
- Complete roof replacement if the existing roof still has life left. A roof inspection report showing 10+ years remaining is often good enough for buyers.

### Typical Flip Renovation Timelines

Time is money on a flip. Every extra week is another month of holding costs. A well-run renovation should take:

- **Cosmetic flip** (paint, flooring, fixtures, minor kitchen and bath updates): **3 to 5 weeks**
- **Moderate renovation** (kitchen remodel, bath remodel, some layout changes, new flooring throughout): **6 to 10 weeks**
- **Major rehab** (structural work, roof, plumbing or electrical overhaul, full gut): **12 to 16+ weeks**

Permits are the wild card. If you're doing anything beyond cosmetic work in Orange or Osceola County, you're pulling [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida). Factor **2 to 4 weeks** of review time into your project schedule.

### Common Investor Mistakes

We work with a lot of investors, and these are the mistakes we see over and over:

- **Underestimating the scope.** You bought what you thought was a cosmetic flip, then discovered the plumbing is polybutylene and the electrical panel is a Federal Pacific. Budget extra for the unknowns.
- **Hiring the cheapest contractor.** Low bids often mean cut corners, missed inspections, or a crew that disappears halfway through. A reliable contractor who finishes on time saves you money even if their bid is a little higher.
- **Over-improving for the neighborhood.** Don't build a $500,000 house in a $350,000 neighborhood. Know your comps and renovate accordingly.
- **Skipping the inspection before purchasing.** Spend the **$400** on a thorough home inspection. It will save you from buying someone else's money pit.
- **Not having a contractor lined up before closing.** The day you close is the day renovations should start. Don't waste weeks finding a crew after you already own the property.

### Working With the Right Contractor

Flip investors need a contractor who works differently than someone building a custom home. You need fast turnarounds, transparent pricing, and a crew that shows up every day. At J&N StructureWorks, we work with investors across the Orlando metro and understand that every week on the timeline matters to your bottom line.`

    date: "2025-08-15",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `## Finding a Contractor You Can Actually Trust

Picking the wrong contractor is one of the most expensive mistakes you can make. We hear horror stories all the time from homeowners who hired someone based on a low bid or a smooth sales pitch and ended up with half-finished work, blown budgets, and a guy who stopped returning calls. It doesn't have to go that way. You just need to know what to look for and what to run from.

### Step 1: Verify Their License

This is not optional. In Florida, general contractors must hold a state license issued by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). You can look up any contractor at **myfloridalicense.com** in about 30 seconds.

What you're checking:
- The license is **active**, not expired, suspended, or revoked
- The license type matches the work they're proposing (a residential contractor license for home construction, a building contractor license for larger projects)
- There are no disciplinary actions on file

If someone tells you they don't need a license for the work they're doing, that's almost always wrong. Walk away.

### Step 2: Confirm Insurance

Ask to see a current Certificate of Insurance. You need to see two things:

- **General liability insurance** with at least **$1,000,000** in coverage. This protects you if something goes wrong during construction, like property damage or an injury on your land.
- **Workers' compensation insurance** that covers their crew. If a worker gets hurt on your job site and the contractor doesn't carry workers' comp, you could be on the hook.

Call the insurance company listed on the certificate to verify it's current. Certificates can be forged or outdated.

### Step 3: Get Multiple Bids (But Don't Just Pick the Cheapest)

Get at least **3 bids** for your project. When you compare them:

- Make sure everyone is bidding on the same scope of work. An apples-to-oranges comparison is useless.
- The lowest bid isn't always the best. If one contractor is **30% below** the others, ask yourself why. They might be cutting corners, using cheaper materials, or planning to hit you with change orders later.
- Look for itemized bids that break down costs by category (demolition, framing, plumbing, electrical, finishes, etc.). A one-line bid that just says "Kitchen remodel - $45,000" doesn't tell you anything.

### Step 4: Check References and Past Work

Ask for **3 to 5 references** from recent projects similar to yours. When you call them, ask:

- Did the project come in on budget?
- Did it finish on time?
- How was communication throughout the project?
- Were there any issues, and how were they handled?
- Would you hire them again?

Also look at online reviews, but take them with a grain of salt. A few negative reviews out of dozens might just be noise. A pattern of complaints about the same issue (no-shows, cost overruns, sloppy work) is a red flag.

### Step 5: Read the Contract Before You Sign

A good contract protects both sides. Make sure it includes:

- Detailed scope of work
- Total price with a payment schedule tied to milestones (not a big lump sum upfront)
- Start date and estimated completion date
- Allowances for materials you haven't selected yet
- How change orders are handled and priced
- Warranty information
- [Permit](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) responsibilities (the contractor should be pulling permits, not you)

Never pay more than **10 to 15%** upfront as a deposit. Florida law limits contractor deposits to **10%** of the contract price or **$1,000**, whichever is less, unless the contractor has a surety bond.

### Red Flags That Should Send You Running

- They want a big cash payment upfront and don't want to put anything in writing
- They can't provide a license number or insurance certificate
- They pressure you to start immediately without a signed contract
- They show up in an unmarked truck with no company info
- The bid is dramatically lower than everyone else's
- They suggest skipping permits to save time and money
- They have no physical business address, just a phone number
- They refuse to provide references

### The Contractor Relationship

Building or [renovating a home](/WholeHomeRenovations) is a partnership that lasts months. You want someone who communicates well, shows up when they say they will, and treats your project like it matters. At [J&N StructureWorks](/Contact), we're happy to provide our license, insurance, references, and detailed bids to anyone considering working with us. That's how it should work.`

    content: `## ADUs Are Having a Moment in Florida

Accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, have been around for a long time. But recent changes to Florida law have made them a much more realistic option for homeowners across the state. Whether you want to build a guest house for aging parents, create a rental unit for extra income, or just add a detached home office, ADUs are worth a serious look.

### What Counts as an ADU?

An ADU is a secondary dwelling unit on a single-family residential lot. It can be:

- A **detached structure** (standalone guest house or cottage)
- An **attached [addition](/RoomAdditions)** to the main house with its own entrance
- A **garage conversion** turned into a living space
- A **converted space** above an existing garage

To qualify as a true ADU, it needs its own kitchen, bathroom, sleeping area, and separate entrance. It's basically a small, independent home on the same lot as your primary residence.

### Florida's New ADU Laws

Florida passed legislation (SB 102, effective July 2023) that preempts local governments from outright banning ADUs on single-family residential lots. That's a big deal because many cities and counties previously made it nearly impossible to build one.

What the law does:
- Requires local governments to allow ADUs on lots zoned for single-family residential use
- Prohibits local governments from requiring the owner to live in either the primary home or the ADU (this was a big barrier before)
- Allows ADUs to be used as rental units
- Still allows local governments to set reasonable standards for size, setbacks, parking, and design

What the law doesn't do:
- It doesn't override HOA restrictions. If your HOA covenants prohibit ADUs or accessory structures, the state law doesn't help you.
- It doesn't waive permitting requirements. You still need to go through the full permit process.

### What It Costs to Build an ADU in Central Florida

ADU costs depend heavily on size, finishes, and whether you're building from scratch or converting existing space.

- **Garage conversion:** $30,000 to $60,000. You're working with an existing structure, so costs are lower. Adding plumbing for a kitchen and bath is the biggest expense.
- **Detached ADU (400 to 600 sq ft):** $80,000 to $150,000. This is a ground-up build with its own foundation, utilities, and everything.
- **Detached ADU (600 to 1,000 sq ft):** $120,000 to $200,000+. A larger unit with a full kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and living area.
- **Above-garage unit:** $60,000 to $120,000. The structure already exists, but you're adding living space with plumbing, electrical, and HVAC.

### The Permitting Process

Building an ADU in [Orange County](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida), [Seminole County](/Blog/seminole-county-building-requirements), or anywhere else in Central Florida requires permits. The process looks similar to any new construction:

1. **Check local zoning** to confirm ADU eligibility on your lot and learn about size and setback restrictions
2. **Hire an architect or designer** to draw up plans that meet the Florida Building Code
3. **Submit plans** to the county building department for review
4. **Address reviewer comments** and get approval
5. **Pull your permits** and begin construction
6. **Schedule inspections** at each phase, just like a regular build
7. **Receive your Certificate of Occupancy** when the unit is complete

Plan for **4 to 8 weeks** for the permitting phase, depending on the county.

### Design Considerations

A few things to think about as you plan:

- **Parking.** Some municipalities require an additional parking space for the ADU. Check your local requirements.
- **Utility connections.** You can tap into the main house's utilities or run separate meters. Separate meters make it easier if you're renting the unit out.
- **Privacy.** Placement on the lot matters. You want both the main house and the ADU to feel like they have their own space.
- **Style.** Most local regulations require the ADU to be architecturally consistent with the main house. It doesn't have to match exactly, but it shouldn't look out of place.

### Rental Income Potential

An ADU in the [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) metro area can bring in real money:

- A well-finished **1-bed, 1-bath ADU** in a decent location can rent for **$1,200 to $1,800 per month** on a standard lease
- Short-term rental income through platforms like Airbnb or Vrbo can be higher, but check local short-term rental regulations first. Orange County and several municipalities have specific rules about this.
- Even at **$1,400 per month** in rent, you're looking at **$16,800 per year** in income. That's a solid return on your investment.

Lake County is becoming one of the most popular places to build in the greater Orlando area, and it's easy to see why. You get more land for your money, the commute into Orlando has gotten easier with the 429 extension and widening of US-27, and the rolling hills and lakes give it a different feel from the flat suburban sprawl further east. But Lake County has its own set of rules, fees, and quirks that are worth understanding before you commit.

### Why Lake County?

- **More affordable land** compared to Orange County. Lots in the [Clermont](/ServiceAreaClermont) and Groveland corridor that would cost twice as much in Horizon West or [Winter Garden](/ServiceAreaWinterGarden) are still available at reasonable prices.
- **Larger lot sizes** in many areas. If you want a half-acre or more, Lake County is where you'll find it without paying a premium.
- **Growing infrastructure.** New schools, commercial development, and road improvements are happening steadily, especially along the US-27 and SR-50 corridors.
- **Scenic beauty.** The chain of lakes, rolling terrain, and preservation areas give Lake County a character you don't get in the flatter parts of Central Florida.

### The Permit Process

Lake County's building department operates out of Tavares. The process follows the same general structure as other Central Florida counties:

1. **Submit your plans** including architectural, structural, and site plans. Lake County has an online portal for submissions.
2. **Plan review** typically takes **10 to 20 business days** for residential construction.
3. **Address any comments** from reviewers and resubmit if needed.
4. **Pay fees and receive your permit.**
5. **Schedule inspections** at each construction milestone. The county requires **24-hour advance notice** for inspection scheduling.

Lake County has been investing in their building department staff, and turnaround times have improved. That said, during busy periods you might wait a bit longer for reviews.

### Impact Fees (2025 Estimates)

Lake County's impact fees for a single-family home:

- Transportation: roughly **$4,900**
- Schools: roughly **$4,100**
- Parks and Recreation: roughly **$800**
- Fire and EMS: roughly **$500**
- Law Enforcement: roughly **$350**
- Library: roughly **$200**
- **Total: approximately $10,850**

That's lower than both Orange County (roughly **$14,000+**) and [Osceola County](/Blog/osceola-county-new-construction-guide) (roughly **$16,900**). The impact fee savings alone can offset some of the slightly longer commute for people who work in Orlando.

### Growth Areas to Watch

#### Clermont
Clermont is the biggest growth story in Lake County. The population has exploded over the past decade, and it's still going. Neighborhoods along Hartwood Marsh Road, the Wellness Way corridor south of town, and the areas between Clermont and Groveland are where a lot of new construction is happening. Great schools, retail, and easy access to the 429 make this a popular choice for families.

#### Mount Dora
Mount Dora has a completely different vibe. It's a charming small town with a historic downtown, and it attracts people who want something quieter. There's new construction happening on the outskirts, particularly south of town along US-441 and in new developments off Round Lake Road. Land prices are a bit higher here because of the demand, but you're paying for the character of the area.

#### Tavares and Eustis
These towns along the shores of Lake Dora and Lake Eustis are growing more quietly but steadily. Land is affordable, and you can still find lakefront or lake-adjacent lots at reasonable prices. The downtown areas are revitalizing with new restaurants and shops. If you don't need to be close to Orlando every day, these are worth considering.

#### Groveland and Mascotte
South Lake County along US-27. This is where you'll find the most affordable land in the county right now. Groveland in particular is seeing rapid residential development. The tradeoff is that it's further from the Orlando core and the commercial development hasn't fully caught up yet, but it's coming.

### How Lake County Differs from Orange and Seminole

A few things stand out when you compare:

- **Lower impact fees** save you money upfront. That $4,000 to $6,000 difference adds up.
- **Larger lots are easier to find.** In Orange County, especially in Horizon West, you're often looking at lots under a quarter acre. In Lake County, half-acre and one-acre lots are common in many areas.
- **Well and septic** are more common in unincorporated Lake County, especially in rural areas. Municipal water and sewer are available in Clermont, Mount Dora, and Tavares, but outside city limits, plan on a well and septic system, which adds **$15,000 to $25,000** to your build cost.
- **Tree and environmental regulations** are present but generally less restrictive than Seminole County's Wekiva Protection Area rules.
- **HOA-free living** is still possible. Many Lake County lots outside master-planned communities don't have HOA restrictions, which gives you more freedom on your design.

### A Couple Things to Watch Out For

- **Commute times.** If you work in downtown Orlando, you're looking at 45 to 60+ minutes depending on where in Lake County you build. The 429 toll road helps, but it costs money every day.
- **Elevation changes.** Lake County has hills. That's part of the appeal, but it also means some lots need more site work and retaining walls. Get a survey and soil test before you buy.
- **Rural lot infrastructure.** Some cheaper lots outside the growth corridors might not have paved road access, nearby electrical service, or internet options beyond satellite. Drive out and look before you buy.

    content: `## Warning Signs You Should Never Ignore

Hiring a contractor is one of the biggest financial decisions most homeowners will make. Get it right and your project runs smooth. Get it wrong and you could be out tens of thousands of dollars with nothing to show for it. We have seen it all in Central Florida, and these are the five biggest warning signs that should make you think twice before signing anything.

### 1. They Can't Show You a Valid State License

This is the most basic check you can do, and it takes about 30 seconds. Every general contractor in Florida is required to hold an active license through the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). Go to **myfloridalicense.com** and type in their name or license number.

If their license is expired, suspended, or doesn't exist at all, stop the conversation right there. An unlicensed contractor can't legally pull [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida), which means your project is operating outside the law from day one. If something goes wrong, you have almost zero legal recourse.

We have talked to homeowners who found out halfway through a build that their "contractor" was never licensed. At that point, you're stuck.

### 2. They Want a Huge Payment Upfront

Florida law caps contractor deposits at **10% of the contract price or $1,000**, whichever is less, unless the contractor has a payment and performance bond. If someone is asking you for 30%, 40%, or half the project cost before they have even picked up a hammer, that is a massive red flag.

Legitimate contractors use a draw schedule tied to completed work milestones. You pay as work gets done, not before. A contractor who needs all the money upfront either has cash flow problems or is planning to disappear. Either way, you lose.

### 3. They Won't Put Anything in Writing

"Don't worry, we'll figure it out as we go." That sentence has cost homeowners in Florida millions of dollars. If a contractor won't give you a detailed written contract that spells out the scope of work, the total price, the timeline, the payment schedule, and how [change orders](/Blog/how-change-orders-work-in-construction) are handled, do not hire them.

A handshake deal might feel friendly, but it leaves you completely exposed when things go sideways. And in construction, things go sideways sometimes. The contract is what protects you.

### 4. They Have No Proof of Insurance

You need to see two things: **general liability insurance** and **workers' compensation insurance**. Ask for a current Certificate of Insurance and call the insurance company to verify it is active.

Why does this matter? If a worker gets hurt on your property and the contractor doesn't carry workers' comp, you could be held liable. If the contractor causes damage to your home or your neighbor's property and doesn't have liability coverage, guess who's paying for it?

This is not a small thing. It is a financial exposure that could cost you everything.

### 5. They Pressure You to Decide Right Now

"This price is only good today." "I have another job starting next week, so if you don't commit now I can't fit you in." "I'll knock $5,000 off if you sign tonight."

High-pressure sales tactics are a hallmark of contractors you don't want to work with. A legitimate [general contractor](/Blog/how-to-choose-a-contractor-central-florida) is confident in their work and their pricing. They will give you a quote, answer your questions, and let you make a decision on your own timeline.

Anyone who is trying to rush you into a commitment doesn't want you to have time to check their references, compare bids, or read the fine print. That should tell you everything you need to know.

### What to Do Instead

- Always verify the license at myfloridalicense.com
- Get at least **3 bids** and compare them carefully
- Ask for references and actually call them
- Read every word of the contract before signing
- Never pay more than what Florida law allows upfront

At [J&N StructureWorks](/Contact), we are happy to show you our license, our insurance, our references, and a detailed written proposal any time you ask. That is how every contractor should operate.`

    content: `## Construction Fraud Is More Common Than You Think

Florida consistently ranks among the top states for construction fraud complaints. Between the constant demand for building and renovation work, the hurricane season repair rush, and the sheer number of people moving here every year, scammers have no shortage of targets. But you don't have to be one of them. Knowing the most common scams and how to protect yourself goes a long way.

### The Most Common Scams in Florida

#### The Storm Chaser

After every hurricane or major storm, unlicensed "contractors" flood into Florida neighborhoods offering to fix roofs, siding, and water damage. They knock on your door, point out damage you may or may not actually have, and offer a great deal if you sign right now. They take your deposit and either do terrible work or disappear entirely.

Storm chasers are not local. They have no reputation to protect and no intention of coming back to fix problems.

#### The Low-Ball Bid

This one is sneaky. A contractor comes in dramatically lower than everyone else on your bid. You think you found a deal. Then once the project starts, the change orders start rolling in. "We didn't include that in the original price." "That's going to be extra." By the time the project is done, you have paid more than the highest original bid, and the quality is usually questionable.

#### The Vanishing Contractor

You pay a large deposit. The contractor shows up for a day or two, maybe does some demolition or drops off some materials. Then they stop showing up. Your calls go to voicemail. Their "office" number is disconnected. Your money is gone and your project is half-demolished.

#### The Permit Skipper

"We don't need permits for this." "Permits just slow things down and cost extra." "The county won't even notice." These are all things a contractor says right before they do work that fails to meet code, can't be insured, and creates a nightmare when you try to sell your home. Unpermitted work is a serious legal and financial problem in Florida.

### How to Protect Yourself

#### Verify Everything

- Check their license at **myfloridalicense.com**
- Call their insurance company to confirm coverage is current
- Look them up on the Better Business Bureau and Google Reviews
- Search for complaints through the Florida DBPR and your local county consumer protection office

#### Get Everything in Writing

A proper contract should include the full scope of work, total price, payment schedule, start and completion dates, warranty terms, and permit responsibilities. If it is not in the contract, it does not exist. Read our guide on [choosing the right contractor](/Blog/how-to-choose-a-contractor-central-florida) for more details on what a good contract looks like.

#### Use a Draw Schedule

Never pay large sums upfront. Tie payments to completed work milestones. A typical [draw schedule](/Blog/how-construction-draw-schedules-work) breaks payments into phases like foundation, framing, rough-ins, and finishes. You inspect the work before releasing each payment.

#### Understand Florida's Construction Lien Law

In Florida, subcontractors and material suppliers can place a lien on your property if they don't get paid, even if you already paid the general contractor. To protect yourself, request **lien waivers** from subcontractors and suppliers as payments are made. This confirms they have been paid and waive their right to lien your property.

### What to Do If You Have Been Scammed

1. **Document everything.** Photos, texts, emails, contracts, receipts, and any other communications.
2. **File a complaint with the DBPR** if the contractor is licensed. The state can take disciplinary action including revoking their license.
3. **File a complaint with your local State Attorney's office.** Construction fraud is a criminal offense in Florida.
4. **Contact the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services** for additional consumer protection resources.
5. **Talk to a construction attorney.** If the dollar amount is significant, legal action may be your best path to recovery.

### The Bottom Line

The best defense against construction scams is doing your homework before you hire anyone. Verify their license, confirm their insurance, check their references, get a detailed written contract, and never pay more upfront than Florida law allows. If something feels off, trust your gut and walk away. There are plenty of honest, hardworking contractors in Central Florida.

    content: `## Honest Talk From the Other Side of the Job

We love what we do. Building homes and renovating spaces for people is genuinely rewarding work. But after years of doing this across Central Florida, there are a few things we wish every homeowner understood before their project starts. None of this is meant to scare anyone off. It is meant to help you go in with realistic expectations so the whole process goes smoother for everyone.

### Your Budget Needs a Cushion

Every single build has surprises. Maybe the soil test comes back showing you need extra fill. Maybe the county changes an impact fee structure between the time you get your estimate and the time you pull your permit. Maybe you walk into the tile showroom and fall in love with something that costs three times what you originally budgeted for flooring.

Set aside **10 to 15%** of your total budget as a contingency. Not because something will definitely go wrong, but because [construction is unpredictable](/Blog/why-construction-projects-go-over-budget) and having that cushion means a surprise doesn't become a crisis.

### Decisions Need to Happen on Time

This is one of the biggest things that slows projects down, and it is almost always in the homeowner's control. When your contractor asks you to pick your tile, your cabinet hardware, your paint colors, or your lighting fixtures by a certain date, that deadline matters.

Late decisions create a domino effect. If your countertop template can't happen because the cabinets aren't ordered because you haven't picked a color, everything behind that gets pushed back. Make your selections during the design phase and stick with them. Your [timeline](/Blog/new-home-construction-timeline) will thank you.

### Weather Is Nobody's Fault

Florida's rainy season runs roughly June through September. If your build is happening during those months, there will be days where exterior work shuts down because of afternoon thunderstorms. That is not your contractor being lazy or falling behind. That is Florida being Florida.

A good contractor builds weather delays into their schedule. But if we get an unusually wet stretch, the timeline is going to shift. Getting frustrated about it doesn't make the rain stop.

### Change Orders Are Not Free

We covered this in detail in our [change orders article](/Blog/how-change-orders-work-in-construction), but it bears repeating here. When you decide to move a wall, add a window, upgrade your appliances, or change your floor plan after construction has started, that costs money and time. Every change requires new materials, potentially new permits, and reworking the schedule.

The best time to make changes is during the design and pre-construction phase when it is just lines on paper. Once framing starts, changes get expensive fast.

### Your Contractor Is Not Ignoring You

Running a construction project means managing subcontractors, suppliers, inspectors, material deliveries, weather, schedules, and your project alongside other active jobs. If your contractor doesn't answer the phone at 2 PM on a Tuesday, they are probably on a roof somewhere or dealing with an inspector.

That said, you should absolutely expect [regular communication](/Blog/why-communication-matters-during-construction). A weekly update, photo documentation, and a reliable way to reach someone with questions are all reasonable expectations. If you are not getting those things, that is a problem. But a missed call here and there is just the reality of a busy construction business.

### Permits Take Time and There Is No Shortcut

The permit process in Florida involves plan submission, county review, possible revisions, and inspections at every phase of construction. None of that can be skipped or rushed. Counties have their own timelines and their own backlogs.

When your contractor tells you permits will take 2 to 4 weeks, they are not padding the schedule. They are giving you a realistic estimate based on experience. Trying to start work before permits are issued is illegal and will cause much bigger problems down the road.

### The Cheapest Option Is Rarely the Best Value

We get it. Construction is expensive. But going with the lowest bid almost always costs you more in the long run. Cheap bids mean cheap materials, cut corners, and a crew that might disappear halfway through. Then you are paying a second contractor to fix what the first one did wrong.

Value is about getting quality work done right the first time by a [licensed, insured professional](/Blog/red-flags-hiring-contractor-florida) who stands behind their work. That is what you should be shopping for.

### We Want Your Project to Go Well

At the end of the day, your success is our success. Happy clients refer their friends and family, leave great reviews, and come back when they need more work done. We have every reason to want your project to go smoothly. Going in with realistic expectations helps make that happen.

    content: `## The Real Reasons Builds Cost More Than Expected

Nobody starts a construction project planning to go over budget. But it happens constantly. National studies put the average cost overrun on residential construction somewhere between **10 and 20%** above the original estimate. In Central Florida, where hurricanes, soil conditions, and fast-changing material prices all play a role, staying on budget takes real planning.

Here are the most common reasons we see projects blow past their numbers, and what you can do about each one.

### Scope Creep and "While You're At It" Changes

This is the number one budget killer. The project starts with a clear plan, and then the homeowner starts adding things. "While you're at it, can you add a window here?" "Actually, I changed my mind on the countertops." "What if we bumped out the master bedroom by two feet?"

Each change feels small in the moment. But they add up fast. A $3,000 window addition here, a $5,000 countertop upgrade there, and a $15,000 room expansion and suddenly you are $25,000 over budget. Every change during construction triggers a [change order](/Blog/how-change-orders-work-in-construction) with real costs attached.

**How to avoid it:** Make every design decision during pre-construction. Once you sign off on the plans, commit to them. Save your wish list for a future project.

### Unforeseen Site Conditions

This is especially common in Central Florida. You start digging and find out the soil needs stabilization. Or the water table is higher than expected. Or there is an old septic tank buried on the lot that nobody knew about. Underground surprises can add **$5,000 to $30,000+** to a project depending on what you find.

**How to avoid it:** Invest in a thorough geotechnical soil test and land survey before construction begins. Spend the **$2,000 to $5,000** upfront so you know what you are working with. Read our guide on [choosing the right lot](/Blog/choosing-the-right-lot-for-your-new-build) for more on this.

### Material Price Increases

Lumber, concrete, steel, and other building materials fluctuate in price. A quote you got in January might not hold in June if material costs spike. We saw this in a big way during 2021 and 2022, and while prices have stabilized somewhat, they still move.

**How to avoid it:** Lock in material pricing early when your contractor offers that option. Build a **5 to 10%** material contingency into your budget. Choose materials that are readily available rather than specialty items with long lead times and volatile pricing.

### Permit and Impact Fee Surprises

Impact fees vary significantly by county in Central Florida. [Orange County](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) fees are different from [Osceola](/Blog/osceola-county-new-construction-guide) or [Lake County](/Blog/lake-county-building-guide). If your contractor's estimate was based on one county's fee schedule and you end up building in another, the difference could be thousands of dollars.

Permit costs can also increase if the county requires plan revisions or additional engineering. Every resubmission takes time and often costs money.

**How to avoid it:** Get exact impact fee numbers from the county where you are building before you finalize your budget. Your contractor should include these in your itemized estimate.

### No Contingency Fund

This is a planning failure, not a construction problem. If you budget every last dollar to the exact cost of the build with nothing left over, the first surprise expense puts you in trouble. A cracked pipe, an inspection that requires additional work, a material substitution that costs a bit more. Something always comes up.

**How to avoid it:** Every construction budget should include a **10 to 15% contingency** on top of the base cost. If you don't use it all, great. You kept the money. But if you need it, you will be glad it is there.

### Poor Initial Planning and Vague Estimates

If your initial estimate is a rough per-square-foot number with no detailed breakdown, you are setting yourself up for overruns. A proper estimate breaks down every line item: site work, foundation, framing, roofing, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, insulation, drywall, finishes, permits, and fees. Each one should have a real number attached to it.

A vague estimate hides costs. A [detailed estimate](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida) exposes them so you can plan accordingly.

**How to avoid it:** Insist on an itemized, detailed estimate from your contractor. If they won't provide one, find someone who will.

### Keeping Your Build on Budget

The common thread in all of these is planning. The more homework you do before breaking ground, the fewer surprises you face during construction. Work with a contractor who gives you transparent pricing, communicates honestly about potential risks, and helps you build a realistic budget from day one.

At J&N StructureWorks, we provide detailed, itemized estimates and walk every client through the numbers before we start. No guesswork and no hidden costs.`

    content: `## What Happens When Plans Change Mid-Build

A change order is a formal modification to the original construction contract. It documents any change to the scope of work, materials, design, or timeline after the contract has been signed and work has begun. Change orders are a normal part of construction. But they need to be handled properly, or they can wreck your budget and your schedule.

### Why Change Orders Happen

Some change orders are the homeowner's choice. You see the framing go up and realize you want a bigger window in the living room. Or you visit the tile showroom and decide to upgrade from the ceramic you originally picked to a porcelain that costs twice as much. Those are voluntary changes.

Other change orders are unavoidable. The building inspector requires additional structural reinforcement that was not in the original plan. The soil conditions are different from what the survey showed. A material you specified is discontinued and the replacement costs more. Those are things nobody could have predicted.

Either way, the process should be the same: document the change, agree on the cost and timeline impact, and sign off before the work happens.

### How Change Order Pricing Works

A legitimate change order should include:

- **A description of the change** in clear, specific language
- **The cost impact**, broken down into materials, labor, and any subcontractor charges
- **The timeline impact**, meaning how many days or weeks the change adds to the project
- **Both signatures** from the homeowner and the contractor before work proceeds

Pricing for change orders typically includes the actual cost of materials and labor plus a markup, usually **15 to 25%**, to cover the contractor's overhead and profit on the additional work. This markup is standard and should be stated in your original contract.

### How Change Orders Affect Your Timeline

Every change order has a ripple effect. Adding a window means reframing part of the wall, which means the electrician needs to reroute wiring, which pushes back insulation and drywall. What sounds like a small change can add a week or more to your [build timeline](/Blog/new-home-construction-timeline).

The bigger changes, like expanding a room or relocating plumbing, can add weeks. And if a change requires a permit revision, add the county's review time on top of that.

### How to Minimize Change Orders

You can't eliminate them entirely. But you can keep them to a minimum:

- **Make all design decisions during pre-construction.** Pick your finishes, your fixtures, your layout, and your materials before the first shovel hits the dirt. The more decisions you make on paper, the fewer you make on the job site.
- **Review your plans thoroughly.** Walk through the floor plan, study the elevations, and make sure you understand every detail before you sign off on construction drawings.
- **Budget for a contingency.** Set aside **10 to 15%** above your contract price to cover [unexpected costs](/Blog/why-construction-projects-go-over-budget). This way, an unavoidable change order doesn't blow up your finances.
- **Communicate with your contractor.** If you are thinking about a change, bring it up as early as possible. A change discussed during framing costs a fraction of what it costs during the finish phase.

### Your Rights as a Homeowner

In Florida, no work should be done on a change order until both parties have agreed in writing to the cost and scope. If a contractor does additional work without your written approval and then tries to bill you for it, you have legal ground to dispute that charge.

Keep copies of every change order, every email, and every text message related to changes on your project. Documentation protects you.

### The Bottom Line

Change orders are part of construction. The goal is not to avoid them completely but to minimize them through good planning and handle them properly when they do come up. A good contractor will walk you through every change order honestly, explain the cost and timeline impact, and never proceed without your approval.

At J&N StructureWorks, every change order is documented, priced transparently, and signed by the client before any additional work begins. That is the right way to do it.`

    readTime: "5 min read",
    content: `## The Difference Between a Good Build and a Nightmare

Ask anyone who has been through a bad construction experience what went wrong, and nine times out of ten the answer involves communication. The contractor stopped returning calls. Nobody told them about the delay. They found out about extra charges after the work was already done. Problems on a construction project almost always start as communication failures.

### What Good Communication Looks Like

#### Regular Progress Updates

You should hear from your contractor at least once a week with a status update. That update should cover what got done that week, what is planned for the following week, any issues that came up, and any decisions that need your input. Photos or a quick video walkthrough make this even better.

You should not have to chase your contractor for information. If you are constantly the one reaching out to ask what is going on, that is a problem.

#### Clear Decision Deadlines

Your contractor should tell you well in advance when they need a decision from you and what the deadline is. Something like "We need your tile selection by March 15th or we push the floor installation back two weeks" gives you the information and the timeline to act on it.

Last-minute "We need this today" situations should be rare. If they are happening constantly, the project is not being managed well.

#### Honest Conversations About Problems

Things go wrong during construction. It rains for two weeks straight. An inspection fails. A material gets backordered. A good contractor tells you about problems as soon as they know about them, along with a plan for how to deal with it.

A bad contractor hides problems, avoids your calls when things go south, and hits you with bad news only when they have no other choice. By then, it is usually worse than it needed to be.

### What You Can Do as a Homeowner

Communication goes both ways. Here is how you can help the process:

- **Respond to your contractor promptly.** When they ask for a decision or send you something to review, get back to them as fast as you can. Delayed responses create [delayed timelines](/Blog/new-home-construction-timeline).
- **Designate one point of contact.** If both you and your spouse are emailing the contractor with different instructions, things are going to get confused. Pick one person to be the main contact and keep the communication streamlined.
- **Ask questions when you don't understand something.** There is no such thing as a stupid question when it comes to your home. If you don't understand a line item, a process, or a decision, ask. A good contractor will explain it.
- **Put important things in writing.** Verbal agreements get forgotten. If you discuss a change, a concern, or a decision, follow it up with an email or text so there is a record.

### Warning Signs of Poor Communication

- You consistently can't reach your contractor for days at a time
- You find out about schedule changes after the fact
- Charges appear on invoices that were never discussed
- Subcontractors show up and you have no idea what they are there to do
- Your questions get vague or dismissive responses

If you are experiencing any of these, it is time for a direct conversation with your contractor about expectations. If nothing changes, you may want to consult a construction attorney about your options.

### Why It Matters for Your Budget

Poor communication does not just cause frustration. It costs real money. A misunderstood material selection means tearing out and redoing work. A missed decision deadline means idle subcontractors who still get paid. An undisclosed [change order](/Blog/how-change-orders-work-in-construction) means a bill you were not expecting.

Good communication prevents all of those things.

At J&N StructureWorks, we keep every client in the loop throughout their entire project. Weekly updates, photo documentation, and a direct line to your project manager are standard on every build. Your home is too important for guesswork.`

    content: `## When a Property's Problems Are Bigger Than You Think

If you are buying investment properties in Central Florida, you are going to run into structural issues sooner or later. Some of them are fixable at a reasonable cost. Others will eat your entire profit margin and then some. Knowing the difference is what separates experienced investors from people who lose money on bad deals.

### Foundation Problems

Florida homes sit on concrete slab foundations, and those slabs can develop issues over time. The most common problems include:

- **Settling and cracking** from changes in the underlying soil. Central Florida has sandy soil and areas with high water tables, both of which can cause uneven settling.
- **Sinkhole activity.** This is a real concern in parts of Orange, Osceola, and Lake counties. Even small sinkholes can cause foundation movement that cracks walls, jams doors, and creates serious structural compromise.
- **Water intrusion** through slab cracks, especially in older homes without proper moisture barriers.

**Cost to repair:** Minor crack sealing runs **$500 to $2,000**. Foundation stabilization with piers or underpinning can run **$5,000 to $30,000+** depending on the severity. Sinkhole remediation is a different animal entirely and can cost **$50,000 to $100,000+**.

**When to walk away:** If a structural engineer tells you the foundation needs major underpinning or if there is confirmed sinkhole activity, the numbers rarely work on a flip. For a long-term hold, maybe, but factor in the full remediation cost plus ongoing monitoring.

### Roof Damage

The roof is the most expensive single component of a house. In Florida, where hurricanes, tropical storms, and intense UV exposure take a constant toll, roof problems are everywhere.

- **Age.** A shingle roof in Florida lasts about **15 to 20 years**. A tile roof can go **25 to 50 years** depending on the type. If the roof is near or past its expected lifespan, budget for replacement.
- **Hurricane damage** that was never properly repaired. Look for missing shingles, lifted tiles, damaged flashing, and signs of previous leaks in the attic.
- **Structural roof damage** from fallen trees or severe wind. This goes beyond roofing material and into the trusses and decking underneath.

**Cost to repair:** A full roof replacement on a typical 2,000 square foot home runs **$12,000 to $25,000+** depending on the material. Structural truss repairs add more.

**When to walk away:** If the roof needs full replacement AND there is evidence of long-term water intrusion into the attic and walls, the damage often extends well beyond just the roof.

### Water Intrusion and Mold

Water finds its way into everything in Florida. The combination of heat, humidity, and heavy rain creates perfect conditions for moisture problems.

- **Roof leaks** that have gone unaddressed for months or years
- **Plumbing leaks** inside walls, especially in older homes with galvanized or polybutylene pipes
- **Poor drainage** around the foundation allowing water to pool against exterior walls
- **Failed window and door seals** letting rain in during storms

The water itself is the first problem. Mold is the second. Florida's climate means mold can establish itself quickly once moisture gets in. Professional mold remediation on a whole house can cost **$10,000 to $30,000+**.

**When to walk away:** If mold has spread through wall cavities, insulation, and HVAC ductwork, the remediation cost can approach or exceed the cost of gutting the house. Run the numbers carefully.

### Termite Damage

Subterranean termites are everywhere in Central Florida. They eat wood framing, and by the time you see evidence of them, they have usually been there for years.

- Look for hollow-sounding wood, mud tubes on foundation walls, and sagging floors or ceilings
- A termite inspection costs about **$75 to $150** and is worth every penny
- Treatment for an active infestation runs **$1,500 to $5,000**
- Repairing the structural damage they caused can cost far more

**When to walk away:** If termites have compromised load-bearing framing members, the repair costs can escalate quickly into the tens of thousands.

### Unpermitted Work

This is not a structural issue per se, but it kills deals constantly. Previous owners or unlicensed contractors added rooms, enclosed porches, converted garages, or modified structures without [pulling permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida). When you try to sell or insure the property, unpermitted work becomes your problem.

**Cost to resolve:** Getting unpermitted work permitted after the fact can cost **$5,000 to $20,000+**, and the county may require you to open walls, demonstrate code compliance, or even tear out work that does not meet current standards.

### Protect Yourself

- Always get a thorough home inspection from a licensed inspector
- Order a structural engineering report if anything looks questionable
- Get a termite inspection on every property
- Check permit records with the county before you close
- Build repair costs into your [due diligence numbers](/Blog/due-diligence-checklist-florida-investors)

At J&N StructureWorks, we work with investors across the [Orlando](/ServiceAreaOrlando) metro to evaluate properties and provide realistic repair and renovation estimates. Knowing the true cost before you close is the difference between a profitable deal and a money pit.`

    content: `## Do Your Homework Before You Write That Check

Due diligence is where real estate deals are made or lost. The exciting part is finding the property. The important part is verifying that the property is actually a good investment before you commit your money. We have seen investors skip steps to close faster and regret it every single time.

Here is the checklist we recommend to every investor we work with in Central Florida.

### 1. Title Search and Title Insurance

Before anything else, make sure the property has a clean title. A title search reveals:

- Outstanding liens (mortgage, tax, contractor, or HOA liens)
- Ownership disputes or unresolved probate issues
- Easements that could affect your plans for the property
- Code enforcement liens from the city or county

Title insurance protects you if something was missed. It is a one-time cost and it is worth it.

### 2. Full Home Inspection

Hire a licensed home inspector to go through the property top to bottom. This is not the time to cut corners to save **$400**. A good inspection covers:

- Roof condition and estimated remaining life
- Foundation and structural integrity
- Electrical system (panel, wiring type, safety concerns)
- Plumbing system (pipe material, water heater, fixtures)
- HVAC condition and age
- Windows and doors
- Moisture and mold indicators
- Exterior drainage and grading

If the inspector flags anything [structural](/Blog/structural-issues-that-kill-real-estate-deals), get a structural engineer involved before you proceed.

### 3. Termite Inspection

This is separate from the general home inspection and it is not optional in Florida. Subterranean termites are a constant threat in Central Florida. A WDO (wood-destroying organism) report costs about **$75 to $150** and tells you if there is active or past termite activity and what damage exists.

### 4. Permit History Check

Pull the permit records from the county. This tells you:

- What work has been done to the property with proper permits
- Whether any permits were pulled but never closed (meaning the work was never inspected)
- Whether there are obvious additions or modifications that were done without permits

Unpermitted work is a liability. It can affect your insurance, your resale value, and your ability to get a certificate of occupancy if you do future work.

### 5. Insurance Quote

Get an insurance quote before you close. Florida property insurance has gotten expensive and complicated in recent years. Some properties, especially older ones with original roofs, can be very difficult or costly to insure.

Factors that affect your premium:
- Roof age and material
- Distance from the coast
- Flood zone status
- [Hurricane protection features](/Blog/hurricane-resistant-home-construction) (or lack thereof)
- Claims history on the property

If the insurance cost is significantly higher than you budgeted, it changes your ROI calculation.

### 6. Comparable Sales Analysis

Know what similar properties in the area are selling for, both as-is and after renovation. Your comps should be:

- Within a **half-mile to one-mile** radius of your property
- Similar in size, bed/bath count, and lot size
- Sold within the last **3 to 6 months**
- In similar condition (compare renovated comps for your ARV and as-is comps for your purchase price)

### 7. Renovation Cost Estimate

Get a real estimate from a licensed contractor before you close. Not a guess, not a number from an online calculator, and not what your buddy thinks it will cost. Walk the property with your contractor and get an itemized estimate that covers:

- Demolition and cleanup
- Structural repairs if needed
- Roof work
- Plumbing and electrical updates
- [Kitchen](/Blog/kitchen-renovation-guide-central-florida) and [bathroom](/Blog/bathroom-renovation-mistakes-to-avoid) renovations
- Flooring, paint, and finishes
- Exterior work and landscaping
- Permit costs

Build a **15 to 20% contingency** on top of that estimate.

### 8. Holding Cost Calculation

Every month you own the property costs money. Calculate your monthly holding costs:

- Mortgage or financing payment
- Property taxes (prorated monthly)
- Insurance
- Utilities
- HOA fees if applicable
- Property management if applicable
- Lawn care and maintenance

Multiply that monthly cost by your expected hold time plus 2 extra months as a buffer.

### 9. ROI Projection

Now put it all together:

**Total Investment** = Purchase Price + Closing Costs + Renovation Costs + Holding Costs

**Expected Return** = After Repair Value (ARV) minus Total Investment minus Selling Costs (realtor commissions, closing costs, etc.)

If your projected profit margin is below **15%**, the deal is thin. One unexpected expense or a longer-than-planned hold time can erase your profit entirely.

### 10. Zoning and Land Use Verification

Confirm the property's zoning and what you are allowed to do with it. This matters if you plan to:

- Convert to a rental property
- Add an [ADU or guest house](/Blog/adu-guest-house-construction-florida)
- Operate a short-term rental
- Subdivide or develop the lot

### Don't Skip Steps

Every item on this list exists because we have seen investors lose money by not doing it. Due diligence is not the exciting part of real estate investing, but it is the part that protects you.

    content: `## Every Week Waiting on a Permit Costs You Money

For real estate investors, time is literally money. Every day you own a property without generating income or moving toward a sale is a day of holding costs eating into your profit margin. And one of the biggest timeline killers in Central Florida construction is the permitting process.

### How Long Permits Actually Take

Here is what we typically see across Central Florida counties for residential construction and renovation permits:

- **[Orange County](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida):** 2 to 4 weeks for standard residential plan review
- **[Seminole County](/Blog/seminole-county-building-requirements):** 10 to 15 business days
- **[Osceola County](/Blog/osceola-county-new-construction-guide):** 10 to 20 business days
- **[Lake County](/Blog/lake-county-building-guide):** 10 to 20 business days

Those are normal timelines when everything goes smoothly. If the county sends back comments requiring plan revisions, add another round of review time on top of that. We have seen permit processes stretch to **6 to 8 weeks** when revisions are needed.

### Why Delays Happen

#### Incomplete Submissions

This is the number one reason for permit delays. If your plans are missing information, don't include required engineering, or don't address code requirements, the county kicks them back. Every resubmission starts the review clock over.

#### County Backlogs

Building departments have limited staff. When construction is booming, which it has been across Central Florida for years, the review queue gets longer. There is nothing you can do about this except plan for it.

#### Code Compliance Issues

If the proposed work doesn't meet the Florida Building Code, the reviewer will require changes. This is especially common on older properties where new work needs to bring certain systems up to current code standards.

#### Zoning Conflicts

If your renovation changes the use of the property or its footprint, you may trigger zoning review on top of the building permit review. That adds another layer of approvals and potentially more time.

### What This Costs You

Let's run the numbers on a typical [fix-and-flip](/Blog/fix-and-flip-construction-orlando) scenario:

**Monthly holding costs for a typical Central Florida investment property:**
- Financing: **$1,200 to $2,500** (depends on purchase price and loan terms)
- Insurance: **$200 to $400**
- Taxes: **$200 to $500**
- Utilities: **$150 to $300**
- Maintenance and lawn: **$100 to $200**
- **Total: roughly $1,850 to $3,900 per month**

If your permit gets delayed by just **4 extra weeks**, that is nearly **$2,000 to $4,000** in additional holding costs. On a thin-margin flip, that could be the difference between profit and breaking even.

### How to Speed Things Up

You can't control the county's workload, but you can control what you submit and how you prepare.

#### Submit Complete Plans the First Time

This is the single most effective thing you can do. Work with an architect or designer who knows the local code requirements and submit a complete, code-compliant plan set. Incomplete plans get rejected. Complete plans get approved.

#### Do a Pre-Application Meeting

Some counties offer pre-application meetings where you can discuss your project with a reviewer before submitting. This is especially valuable for unusual projects or properties with known issues. It helps you address potential problems before they become rejection reasons.

#### Use an Experienced Contractor

A contractor who has pulled hundreds of permits in your target county knows what the reviewers look for. They know the common sticking points, the specific requirements that trip people up, and how to prepare a submission that sails through. This experience saves you weeks.

#### Have Your Contractor Lined Up Before Closing

Do not wait until after you close on the property to find a contractor and start the permit process. Have your contractor walk the property during due diligence, prepare a scope of work, and be ready to submit for permits the day you close. Every day of prep you do before closing is a day saved on the back end.

#### Factor Permit Time Into Your Pro Forma

When you are calculating your [investment timeline](/Blog/due-diligence-checklist-florida-investors), build in **4 to 6 weeks** for permitting on any project that goes beyond cosmetic work. If it comes in faster, great. If it doesn't, you planned for it.

### The Bottom Line

Permitting is a cost of doing business in Florida construction. It exists for good reasons, and trying to skip it creates much bigger problems down the road. The smart approach is to plan for it, prepare properly, and work with professionals who know how to navigate the process efficiently.

    date: "2026-02-15",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `## Not Every Fire-Damaged Home Is a Bargain

Fire-damaged properties show up regularly on the Central Florida market, often at steep discounts. For investors, they can look like incredible deals. And sometimes they are. But more often than people expect, the cost of properly repairing fire damage exceeds what you would spend demolishing the structure and starting fresh.

Before you buy a fire-damaged property, you need to understand what you are actually dealing with.

### Types of Fire Damage

Not all fire damage is the same, and the type matters enormously for your repair costs and timeline.

#### Surface Damage

The fire was contained to one area or caught early. You are dealing with smoke staining, soot on surfaces, and some localized charring. Walls, ceilings, and flooring in the affected area need replacement, but the structure itself is intact.

**Repair cost range:** $15,000 to $50,000 depending on the size of the affected area and finishes.

#### Moderate Structural Damage

The fire burned long enough or hot enough to compromise some structural elements. Framing members are charred, roof trusses may be weakened, and the heat may have affected the concrete slab or block walls. The structure can potentially be saved, but it needs significant work.

**Repair cost range:** $50,000 to $150,000+ and that number climbs fast if the damage is widespread.

#### Severe Structural Damage

The fire gutted the structure. Roof collapsed, walls are compromised, and the building is essentially a shell. At this point, you are not really repairing. You are rebuilding.

**Repair cost range:** Often exceeds the cost of demolition plus new construction.

### The Hidden Costs

Fire damage comes with costs that are not immediately obvious.

#### Smoke and Soot Remediation

Smoke penetrates everything. It gets into drywall, insulation, ductwork, electrical wiring insulation, and even concrete. Proper smoke remediation requires specialized cleaning, sealing, and often replacement of affected materials throughout the house, not just in the fire area.

#### Water Damage from Firefighting

The fire department used thousands of gallons of water to put the fire out. That water soaked into floors, walls, insulation, and the foundation. In Florida's climate, mold can establish itself within **24 to 48 hours** in wet conditions. If the property sat for any length of time after the fire, mold is almost guaranteed.

#### Hazardous Materials

Homes built before 1978 may contain lead paint. Homes built before the mid-1980s may have asbestos in insulation, floor tiles, or other materials. Fire can disturb these materials and create a hazardous environment that requires professional abatement before any work begins.

**Abatement costs:** $5,000 to $20,000+ depending on what is present and how extensive it is.

#### Insurance Complications

If you are buying a fire-damaged property, the previous owner's insurance situation can affect you. Make sure the insurance claim is fully resolved before closing. Also, getting insurance on a fire-damaged property you have not yet repaired can be difficult and expensive.

### When Repair Makes Sense

Repairing a fire-damaged home can make financial sense when:

- The fire damage is truly surface-level with no [structural compromise](/Blog/structural-issues-that-kill-real-estate-deals)
- The property is in a high-value location where the land and neighborhood justify the investment
- The repair cost plus purchase price is significantly below the After Repair Value
- The structure, foundation, and major systems are intact
- You have a contractor who has experience with fire restoration and can give you a reliable estimate

### When Demolition Makes More Sense

Consider tearing down and rebuilding when:

- Structural damage is extensive across multiple areas of the home
- The roof structure is compromised
- Smoke and water damage permeates the entire structure
- Hazardous material abatement costs are high
- The repair cost approaches **60 to 70%** or more of new construction cost
- The property is in an area where a new build will significantly outperform a repaired structure at resale

In many Central Florida markets, new construction on an existing lot can cost **$150 to $250+ per square foot**. If your repair estimate is approaching that range, building new gives you a better product with modern code compliance, new systems, and a full warranty.

### What Investors Should Do

1. **Never buy a fire-damaged property without a structural engineer's report.** A general home inspector is not enough for this.
2. **Get a detailed repair estimate from a licensed contractor** who has done fire restoration work. Not a guess, not a ballpark, a real number.
3. **Get quotes for both repair and demolition plus rebuild.** Compare them side by side.
4. **Factor in timeline.** Fire restoration is often slower than new construction because of the remediation, abatement, and inspection requirements.
5. **Check with your insurance agent** before closing to make sure you can get coverage during and after the renovation.

    content: `## From an Empty Lot to Your Front Door

"Dirt-to-keys" is a term you will hear in the construction industry that means exactly what it sounds like. A contractor handles everything from the raw, undeveloped dirt on your lot all the way through to handing you the keys to your finished home. It is a complete, start-to-finish construction service.

### What Is Included in Dirt-to-Keys

When a contractor says they do dirt-to-keys work, they should be covering every phase of the build:

#### Pre-Construction
- Site evaluation and soil testing
- Architectural design and engineering
- [Permit applications](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) and approvals
- Material selection and procurement planning
- Detailed budgeting and scheduling

#### Site Work
- Land clearing and grading
- Fill dirt and compaction
- Underground utility connections (water, sewer, electric)
- Stormwater management
- Foundation preparation and slab pour

#### Construction
- Framing, roofing, and exterior finishes
- Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC rough-ins
- Insulation and drywall
- Interior finishes including flooring, cabinetry, countertops, and paint
- Fixture and appliance installation
- Exterior landscaping, driveway, and walkways

#### Close-Out
- All required [inspections](/Blog/what-happens-if-construction-fails-inspection) passed
- Certificate of Occupancy obtained
- Final walkthrough with the homeowner
- Punch list items completed
- Keys handed over

### Why It Matters

The alternative to dirt-to-keys is managing parts of the process yourself. Some homeowners act as their own general contractor or hire separate companies for site work, construction, and finishing. That can work if you know what you are doing, but it comes with risks:

- **Coordination headaches.** When multiple companies are involved, scheduling conflicts and communication gaps are almost guaranteed.
- **Accountability gaps.** If something goes wrong between the site work contractor and the building contractor, who is responsible? With a single dirt-to-keys contractor, the answer is always clear.
- **Budget surprises.** Separate contracts mean separate estimates, and the gaps between them are where unexpected costs hide.
- **Timeline delays.** Every handoff between contractors is an opportunity for the schedule to slip.

A dirt-to-keys contractor owns the entire process. One contract, one point of contact, one company responsible for getting you from an empty piece of land to a finished home.

### What to Ask Your Builder

If a contractor says they offer dirt-to-keys construction, ask them specifically:

- Do you handle the site work yourself or subcontract it?
- Are [permits and impact fees](/Blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-home-in-central-florida) included in your price?
- Does your scope include landscaping, driveway, and irrigation?
- What about the final Certificate of Occupancy and all inspections?
- Is everything covered under one contract with one [draw schedule](/Blog/how-construction-draw-schedules-work)?

Some builders use the term loosely and actually carve out parts of the process. Make sure you know exactly what is and is not included.

### How J&N StructureWorks Does It

At J&N StructureWorks, dirt-to-keys is our standard approach to [custom home construction](/CustomHomes). We handle every step from the initial lot evaluation through the day you walk in your front door. One contract, one team, one point of accountability. That is the way building a home should work.`

    content: `## Move-In Ready, No Assembly Required

A turnkey construction project is one where the builder delivers a completely finished home that is ready to live in the moment you get the keys. You should be able to turn the key in the front door, walk in, and start your life. No unfinished rooms, no pending punch list items, no additional work needed.

### What Turnkey Includes

A true turnkey home should come with:

- **All construction complete** from foundation to finishes
- **All inspections passed** and Certificate of Occupancy issued
- **All fixtures and appliances installed** and working
- **Flooring, paint, and trim** completed throughout
- **Landscaping** installed (at minimum, sod, irrigation, and basic plantings)
- **Driveway and walkways** poured and finished
- **All systems operational** including HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and water heater
- **Garage door opener** installed and programmed
- **Clean and ready for move-in**

### What Turnkey Does Not Always Include

This varies by builder, so always ask. Some things that are sometimes excluded from turnkey:

- **Window treatments** like blinds or curtains
- **Fencing**
- **Pool construction** (usually a separate contract)
- **Furniture and decor** (obviously)
- **Extended landscaping** beyond basic sod and plants
- **Smart home systems** beyond what was specified in the contract

The key is to read your contract carefully and make sure every item you expect is listed. If it is not in writing, do not assume it is included.

### Turnkey vs. Spec Homes

A **spec home** (short for speculative) is a home a builder constructs without a specific buyer lined up. The builder makes all the design decisions and then sells the finished product. Spec homes are turnkey in the sense that they are move-in ready, but the buyer has no input on the design, layout, or finishes.

A **turnkey custom home** is different. You work with the builder during the [design phase](/Blog/new-home-construction-timeline) to select your floor plan, finishes, fixtures, and features. Then the builder handles everything from [dirt-to-keys](/Blog/what-does-dirt-to-keys-construction-mean). You get a custom home built to your specifications, delivered ready to live in.

### Turnkey vs. Semi-Custom

Some builders offer a "semi-custom" approach where you choose from a set of pre-designed floor plans and a limited selection of finishes. This is a middle ground between a spec home and a fully custom build. It can be turnkey, but your choices are more limited.

A fully custom turnkey project gives you the most flexibility. You are involved in every decision from the floor plan to the cabinet hardware, and the builder delivers the finished product.

### Why Turnkey Matters

The biggest advantage of turnkey construction is simplicity. You have **one contract, one builder, and one set of expectations**. You do not need to hire separate contractors for finishing work, landscaping, or appliance installation. Everything is coordinated under one roof.

For buyers who are relocating to Central Florida from out of state, turnkey is especially valuable. You can manage the entire build process remotely and show up to a home that is genuinely ready to live in on day one.

### What to Look for in a Turnkey Builder

- A detailed contract that lists every item included in the turnkey scope
- A clear [draw schedule](/Blog/how-construction-draw-schedules-work) tied to construction milestones
- A defined warranty on all work and materials
- [Proper licensing and insurance](/Blog/red-flags-hiring-contractor-florida)
- A track record of completing projects on time and on budget
- Clear communication throughout the build process

J&N StructureWorks delivers turnkey [custom homes](/CustomHomes) across Central Florida. When we hand you the keys, your home is complete, inspected, and ready for your family. That is our commitment on every project.`

    content: `## Understanding Florida Contractor Licenses

If you are hiring a contractor in Florida, you have probably seen the abbreviations CBC and CGC thrown around. They stand for Certified Building Contractor and Certified General Contractor, respectively. They are both legitimate state licenses, but they cover different scopes of work. Knowing the difference helps you make sure the person you hire is actually qualified for your project.

### What Is a CBC?

A **Certified Building Contractor (CBC)** is a state license issued by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). It authorizes the holder to build, renovate, or repair residential and commercial buildings up to a certain scope.

Specifically, a CBC can:

- Build **residential structures** of any size (single-family homes, duplexes, townhomes)
- Build **commercial structures up to three stories**
- Perform renovations, remodeling, and repairs on both residential and commercial buildings within their scope
- Pull permits and manage all aspects of the construction process
- Hire and oversee subcontractors for plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and other specialty trades

A CBC license is valid statewide in Florida. If someone holds a CBC, they can work in any Florida county without needing a separate local license.

### CBC vs. CGC

A **Certified General Contractor (CGC)** has a broader scope. In addition to everything a CBC can do, a CGC can:

- Build commercial structures of **any height or size**
- Take on large-scale commercial projects, institutional buildings, and multi-story developments

For residential construction, which includes [custom homes](/CustomHomes), renovations, room additions, and most projects homeowners need, a **CBC is fully qualified**. You only need a CGC if your project involves large commercial buildings beyond three stories.

### How to Get a CBC in Florida

Getting a CBC license is not easy, and that is intentional. The requirements ensure that only qualified individuals hold the license.

1. **Experience:** You need at least **4 years** of proven construction experience. This can be a combination of hands-on work and education.
2. **Exam:** You must pass the state licensing exam, which covers construction methods, building codes, business practices, and Florida-specific regulations. The pass rate is not high. It is a difficult exam.
3. **Financial stability:** You must demonstrate financial responsibility, usually through financial statements reviewed by the DBPR.
4. **Insurance:** You need general liability insurance and workers' compensation coverage (or an exemption if you have no employees).
5. **Background check:** The DBPR runs a criminal background check on all applicants.
6. **Continuing education:** Once licensed, CBCs must complete **14 hours of continuing education** every two years to keep their license active. This includes updates on building code changes, workplace safety, and business practices.

### How to Verify a CBC License

Go to **myfloridalicense.com** and search by the contractor's name, business name, or license number. The site will show you:

- Whether the license is **active, expired, or suspended**
- The license type (CBC, CGC, etc.)
- Any disciplinary actions on file
- The contractor's business address

This takes 30 seconds and should be the [first thing you do](/Blog/red-flags-hiring-contractor-florida) before hiring any contractor.

### Why It Matters

An unlicensed contractor operating in Florida is breaking the law. More importantly, they are putting you at risk:

- **No accountability.** If something goes wrong, the DBPR has no jurisdiction over an unlicensed operator.
- **No insurance requirement.** Unlicensed contractors are not required to carry insurance, which means you are exposed if someone gets hurt or property is damaged.
- **Permits may not be valid.** Only licensed contractors can pull permits. If an unlicensed person pulls a permit using someone else's license (a practice called "license lending"), that is illegal and the permit can be voided.
- **No warranty backing.** A warranty from an unlicensed contractor is worth nothing because there is no regulatory body to enforce it.

    content: `## Two Terms That Mean Different Things

People use "general contractor" and "builder" interchangeably all the time, and in casual conversation that is fine. But when you are hiring someone to build or renovate your home in Florida, understanding the difference actually matters. The terms carry different legal meanings, different scopes of work, and sometimes different levels of accountability.

### What Is a General Contractor?

A **general contractor (GC)** is a licensed professional who manages and coordinates a construction project. The GC is the person or company responsible for:

- Overseeing the entire project from start to finish
- Hiring, scheduling, and managing subcontractors (electricians, plumbers, roofers, etc.)
- Pulling [permits](/Blog/building-permits-orange-county-florida) and scheduling inspections
- Ordering materials and managing deliveries
- Keeping the project on schedule and on budget
- Ensuring work meets the Florida Building Code

In Florida, a general contractor must hold either a [CBC or CGC license](/Blog/what-is-a-certified-building-contractor) from the DBPR. They carry insurance, they are bonded (in many cases), and they are accountable to the state if something goes wrong.

A GC may or may not do any of the physical construction work themselves. Their primary role is project management and coordination. On a typical home build, the GC hires specialized subcontractors for framing, roofing, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, drywall, painting, and other trades.

### What Is a Builder?

"Builder" is a more general term. In everyday language, a builder is someone who builds homes. But in Florida, the term does not carry a specific legal definition the way "general contractor" does.

In practice, a builder usually refers to a company that:

- Designs and constructs new homes
- May offer pre-designed floor plans or custom design services
- Handles the entire construction process, often using their own in-house crews for some trades
- Markets and sells completed or to-be-built homes

Production builders (like Lennar, DR Horton, or Taylor Morrison) are builders. Custom home builders are also builders. But in both cases, the entity responsible for the construction work must hold a valid Florida contractor's license.

### Where They Overlap

Here is where it gets blurry. A custom home builder IS a general contractor. They hold the same license and perform the same role. The difference is mostly in how they market themselves and what kind of projects they focus on.

- A **GC** might take on a wide variety of projects: home renovations, commercial build-outs, additions, new construction, and specialty work.
- A **builder** typically focuses on new home construction and may offer a more packaged experience with design services, model homes, and a defined process.

Both need the same state license. Both are held to the same legal standards. Both manage subcontractors and pull permits.

### The Owner-Builder Option

Florida allows property owners to act as their own general contractor on their own property. This is called an **owner-builder** exemption. You can pull permits, hire subcontractors, and manage the build yourself.

Should you? That depends on your experience. Owner-builders save on the GC markup (typically **15 to 25%**), but they take on all the responsibility for scheduling, code compliance, quality control, and liability. If you have never managed a construction project before, the money you "save" often gets spent on mistakes, delays, and rework.

Subcontractors also tend to prioritize jobs from licensed GCs they have an ongoing relationship with. As an owner-builder, you may find it harder to get crews scheduled when you need them.

### When You Need a Licensed GC

You need a licensed general contractor for any project that:

- Requires building permits
- Involves structural work
- Includes new construction
- Involves multiple trades (plumbing, electrical, HVAC)
- Has a value exceeding **$5,000** (per Florida statute)

For a [custom home build](/CustomHomes), a major renovation, or a significant [addition](/RoomAdditions), you want a licensed GC managing the project. Full stop.

### The Bottom Line

Whether you call them a GC, a builder, or a contractor, what matters is that they hold a valid Florida license, carry proper insurance, and have a track record of completing projects on time and on budget. The title on their business card matters less than their credentials and their reputation.

J&N StructureWorks is a licensed Florida Certified Building Contractor that operates as both a general contractor and a custom home builder.

    tags: ["draw schedule", "budgeting", "construction financing", "payments"],
    date: "2026-05-01",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `## Paying for Your Build the Right Way

A draw schedule is the payment plan for a construction project. Instead of paying a lump sum upfront or at the end, payments are broken into installments that are released as specific construction milestones are completed. It protects both the homeowner and the contractor by tying money to actual progress.

### How a Typical Draw Schedule Works

Every draw schedule is a little different, but for a new [custom home](/CustomHomes) build in Central Florida, here is a common structure:

1. **Deposit** (5 to 10% of contract) - Due at contract signing
2. **Foundation complete** (10 to 15%) - Slab poured and inspected
3. **Framing complete** (15 to 20%) - Walls up, roof trusses set, dried in
4. **Rough-ins complete** (10 to 15%) - Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC installed and inspected
5. **Drywall complete** (10%) - Drywall hung, taped, and finished
6. **Interior finishes** (15 to 20%) - Cabinets, countertops, flooring, and paint
7. **Final completion** (10 to 15%) - All work done, inspections passed, Certificate of Occupancy issued

The exact percentages and milestones vary by contract. Some draw schedules have five draws, others have eight or more. The important thing is that each payment is tied to verified, completed work.

### How Draws Get Released

#### If You Are Paying Cash

You and your contractor agree on the milestones. When a milestone is complete, the contractor notifies you. You inspect the work (or have an independent inspector check it), and then you release the payment.

#### If You Have a Construction Loan

The process involves your lender. When a draw is due, the contractor submits a draw request to the bank. The bank sends an inspector to the property to verify the work is complete. Once the bank confirms the milestone is met, they release the funds to the contractor.

This extra layer of verification from the bank protects your investment. The bank has a financial interest in making sure work is actually done before they release money.

### Why Draw Schedules Protect You

Without a draw schedule, you are exposed. If you pay a large percentage upfront and the contractor walks away or goes bankrupt, you have already lost that money. Recovering it is a legal battle that takes months or years.

A draw schedule means:

- You never pay for work that has not been done
- The contractor has financial motivation to keep hitting milestones
- There is a natural checkpoint at each phase to review quality
- Your exposure is limited to the current draw amount, not the full contract value

### Red Flags in Draw Schedules

Watch out for these:

- **Front-loaded schedules** where more than **50%** of the total is due before the house is framed. That gives the contractor too much of your money too early.
- **No milestone verification.** If the contractor just invoices you without any requirement for you to confirm the work is complete, that is a problem.
- **A huge final payment** that is too small. If only 5% is held back for the final draw, the contractor has little incentive to come back and finish the punch list.
- **No connection to inspections.** Draws should align with [inspection milestones](/Blog/new-home-construction-timeline) whenever possible, because inspections independently verify that work meets code.

### What to Look For in a Good Draw Schedule

- Payments should be **roughly proportional** to the value of work completed at each phase
- Each milestone should be **clearly defined** so there is no argument about whether it has been met
- The schedule should hold back at least **10%** for the final draw after all work is complete, inspections are passed, and the Certificate of Occupancy is issued
- The contract should state what happens if work stalls (your right to withhold payment, default provisions, etc.)

### Protecting Yourself Further

In addition to your draw schedule, consider these steps:

- **Request lien waivers** from subcontractors and suppliers with each draw. This protects you from [liens on your property](/Blog/how-to-avoid-construction-scams-florida) if the GC does not pay their subs.
- **Document each milestone** with photos and notes before releasing payment
- **Have your attorney review** the draw schedule as part of the overall contract review

### The Bottom Line

A draw schedule is one of the most important parts of your construction contract. It keeps the money flowing in step with the work and gives both sides clear expectations. If a contractor pushes back on using a draw schedule or wants payment terms that feel off, that is a [red flag](/Blog/red-flags-hiring-contractor-florida).

At J&N StructureWorks, every project uses a clear, milestone-based draw schedule. You always know when payments are due and exactly what you are paying for. [Reach out to us](/Contact) to learn more about how we structure our projects.`

    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: `## Failed Inspections Happen More Often Than You Think

A failed inspection sounds scary, but it is a normal part of the construction process. It does not mean your house is falling apart or that your contractor is incompetent. Inspections exist to catch issues before they get buried behind drywall and finishes. When something fails, it gets corrected, reinspected, and the project moves forward.

That said, failed inspections do cost time and sometimes money. Understanding how the process works helps you stay calm and keep your project on track.

### What Inspections Check

During a typical [new home build](/Blog/new-home-construction-timeline) in Florida, your project will go through multiple inspections:

- **Foundation and slab** before framing starts
- **Framing** after the structure is up but before it is closed in
- **Plumbing rough-in** before walls are closed
- **Electrical rough-in** before walls are closed
- **Mechanical (HVAC) rough-in** before walls are closed
- **Insulation** before drywall goes up
- **Final inspection** covering everything before the Certificate of Occupancy is issued

Each inspection is performed by a county building inspector who verifies the work meets the Florida Building Code and the approved plans.

### Common Reasons Inspections Fail

#### Framing Issues
- Missing hurricane straps or clips at truss-to-wall connections
- Incorrect nail spacing on sheathing
- Headers over windows or doors that are undersized
- Deviations from the approved structural plan

#### Plumbing Issues
- Improper slope on drain lines
- Missing cleanouts or access points
- Incorrect pipe sizing
- Failed pressure test

#### Electrical Issues
- Incorrect wire gauge for the circuit
- Missing GFCI protection in required locations (kitchens, bathrooms, exterior)
- Arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) requirements not met in bedrooms
- Panel issues or improper grounding

#### HVAC Issues
- Ductwork not sealed properly
- Refrigerant line issues
- Improper equipment sizing (based on the load calculation)
- Missing or incorrect condensate drain setup

#### Insulation Issues
- Gaps or missing insulation in walls or attic
- Incorrect R-value for the climate zone
- Vapor barrier problems

### The Correction Process

When an inspection fails, here is what happens:

1. **The inspector documents the issues** on a correction notice. This lists every item that needs to be addressed.
2. **Your contractor reviews the corrections** and makes the necessary fixes. This could take a few hours for minor issues or a few days for more significant ones.
3. **Your contractor schedules a re-inspection.** The inspector comes back to verify the corrections were made.
4. **The re-inspection passes** (usually) and the project moves to the next phase.

No work on the next phase can proceed until the current inspection passes. You cannot hang drywall until framing and rough-in inspections are cleared. You cannot move in until the final inspection is passed and your Certificate of Occupancy is issued.

### How It Affects Your Timeline

A minor failed inspection (missing a hurricane strap, a nail spacing issue) might only add **1 to 3 days** to your schedule while the fix is made and re-inspection is scheduled.

A more significant failure (structural issue, plumbing system redesign) could add **1 to 2 weeks** or more, depending on the scope of the correction.

The best way to minimize delays is to work with a [contractor who knows the code](/Blog/how-to-choose-a-contractor-central-florida) inside and out and builds to pass inspections the first time. No contractor has a 100% pass rate on every inspection, but experienced contractors fail far less often than inexperienced ones.

### Who Pays for Corrections?

If the failure is due to the contractor's work not meeting code or not matching the approved plans, the contractor pays for the correction. This is their responsibility. You should not be charged for fixing defective work.

If the failure is due to a code change that happened after the plans were approved, or if the inspector is applying an interpretation of the code that differs from what was anticipated, the situation gets more nuanced. These cases are less common but they do happen. A good contractor will discuss the situation with you honestly and work to resolve it.

### How to Prevent Failures

- **Work with an experienced, licensed contractor** who has a strong track record in your county
- **Make sure plans are complete and code-compliant** before submission
- **Don't rush phases.** Give your contractor time to do the work right before calling for an inspection
- **Stay informed.** Ask your contractor about the inspection schedule and what each inspection covers

### The Bottom Line

A failed inspection is not the end of the world. It is a quality control checkpoint doing its job. The important thing is that corrections are made properly and promptly, and that your contractor handles it without trying to cut corners.

At J&N StructureWorks, we build to pass inspections the first time. When corrections are needed, we address them immediately and keep your project moving forward. That is part of the job.`

    content: `## What Your Builder Should Stand Behind

One of the biggest advantages of buying a new construction home over an existing home is the warranty. When you buy a house that is 10 or 20 years old, you are buying whatever condition it is in. When you build new, you get warranty protection that covers defects in materials and workmanship for a defined period after construction is complete.

But not all warranties are the same, and understanding what yours covers (and what it does not) is important.

### Types of Warranties on New Construction

#### Builder Warranty

This is the warranty your builder provides directly. It typically covers:

- **Workmanship and materials (1 year):** This covers defects in the work performed by the builder and their subcontractors. Things like cracked drywall seams, paint issues, sticking doors, plumbing leaks, and similar quality issues.
- **Mechanical systems (2 years):** This covers your plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems. If a pipe leaks because of a bad joint or your HVAC system has a defect, this warranty covers the repair.
- **Structural components (10 years):** This covers the structural integrity of the home, meaning the foundation, load-bearing walls, roof structure, and other elements critical to the building's structural safety.

These time periods are common in the industry, but they can vary by builder. Read your warranty document carefully.

#### Manufacturer Warranties

Individual products in your home come with their own warranties from the manufacturer:

- **Roofing materials:** 20 to 50 years depending on the product
- **HVAC equipment:** 5 to 10 years on parts, varies on compressor
- **Appliances:** 1 to 5 years depending on the brand
- **Windows:** 10 years to lifetime, depending on the manufacturer
- **Water heater:** 6 to 12 years

These are separate from your builder warranty. If your dishwasher breaks 3 years after move-in, that is an appliance manufacturer warranty claim, not a builder warranty claim.

### Florida Statutory Warranty

Florida law provides implied warranties on new construction that exist regardless of what your written warranty says:

- **Implied warranty of fitness** means the home should be suitable for habitation
- **Implied warranty of merchantability** means the home should be built with adequate materials and workmanship
- **Florida's statute of limitations** for latent construction defects is **4 years** from the time the defect is discovered (or should have been discovered), with a **10-year statute of repose** from the date of completion

These statutory protections exist on top of your written builder warranty.

### How to File a Warranty Claim

1. **Document the issue** with photos, dates, and a written description of the problem.
2. **Contact your builder** in writing. Email is best because it creates a record with a timestamp.
3. **Give the builder reasonable time to respond.** Most warranties specify a response timeframe, often **30 to 60 days** for non-emergency issues.
4. **Allow the builder to inspect and repair.** Under Florida's Right to Repair law (Chapter 558), the builder has the right to inspect the defect and offer a repair before you can file a lawsuit.
5. **Keep records of everything.** Every email, every photo, every repair visit.

### What Can Void Your Warranty

Be aware of these common warranty exclusions:

- **Normal wear and tear.** Warranties cover defects, not normal aging of materials.
- **Homeowner modifications.** If you modify the electrical system, plumbing, or structure without a licensed professional, you may void the warranty on those systems.
- **Failure to maintain.** Not changing HVAC filters, not maintaining caulking and sealants, or ignoring known water intrusion can void related warranty claims.
- **Cosmetic settling.** Minor drywall cracks, nail pops, and concrete slab hairline cracks are typically considered normal settling and may not be covered after the first year.
- **Acts of nature.** Hurricane damage, flooding, lightning strikes, and similar events are insurance claims, not warranty claims.

### What to Do at Your One-Year Walkthrough

Most builders offer a one-year walkthrough before the workmanship warranty expires. This is your chance to document everything. Walk every room, check every door and window, run every faucet, test every outlet, and look at every surface. Make a comprehensive list and submit it to your builder in writing.

Do not wait until month 13 to report a year-one issue. The warranty clock does not stop.

### The Bottom Line

A good warranty backed by a reputable builder gives you peace of mind that your investment is protected. But a warranty is only as good as the company standing behind it. That is why choosing a builder with a solid reputation and a track record of honoring their commitments matters as much as the warranty document itself.

At J&N StructureWorks, we stand behind every [home we build](/CustomHomes). Our warranty covers workmanship, systems, and structural components, and we respond to warranty requests promptly. Your home is our reputation.`

    content: `## What It Actually Takes to Get Licensed

Becoming a licensed general contractor in Florida is not something you do on a whim. The state has some of the toughest licensing requirements in the country, and for good reason. Florida's building code is complex, the hurricane and weather considerations are serious, and the stakes for homeowners and building occupants are high. If you are serious about pursuing this career, here is the full picture of what it takes.

### The Two License Types

Florida offers two levels of general contractor licenses through the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR):

#### Certified Building Contractor (CBC)
- Can build and renovate residential structures of any size
- Can build commercial structures **up to three stories**
- Valid statewide in Florida
- This is the license most residential contractors hold

#### Certified General Contractor (CGC)
- Everything a [CBC](/Blog/what-is-a-certified-building-contractor) can do, plus commercial structures of any size
- Required for large commercial projects, high-rise buildings, and institutional construction
- Also valid statewide

If your goal is to build custom homes and handle residential renovations, a CBC is what you need. If you want to take on larger commercial projects, you will need a CGC.

### Experience Requirements

You need a minimum of **4 years of construction experience** to qualify for the exam. The DBPR accepts different combinations of education and work experience:

- **4 years of on-the-job experience** working under a licensed contractor, with documentation from your employer
- **A 4-year degree in construction management, engineering, or architecture** from an accredited university can substitute for up to 3 years of experience
- **A 2-year degree** in a related field can substitute for up to 2 years of experience

The DBPR reviews your experience documentation carefully. You will need to provide employer verification, project descriptions, and in some cases, reference letters from licensed contractors you have worked with.

### The Licensing Exam

The exam is the part that stops a lot of people. The pass rate for first-time test takers is historically around **50%**, which tells you it is not something you can wing.

The exam consists of multiple parts:

#### Business and Finance
- Contract law and administration
- Project management and scheduling
- Estimating and bidding
- Business accounting and financial management
- Florida construction lien law
- OSHA safety requirements

#### Construction Knowledge
- Florida Building Code (residential or general, depending on your license type)
- Structural systems
- Mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems
- Site work and foundation
- Building envelope and finishes

The exam is **open book**, meaning you can bring reference materials. But do not let that fool you into thinking it is easy. The time pressure is real, and if you do not know where to find information quickly in your code books, you will run out of time.

Most successful candidates spend **3 to 6 months** preparing for the exam, often through a licensed exam prep course. Companies like Gold Coast Schools and the Florida Contractor Exam School offer comprehensive prep programs.

### Financial Requirements

The DBPR requires you to demonstrate financial stability:

- **Financial statement** prepared by a CPA (not just a tax return)
- The statement must show a positive **net worth** and adequate **working capital** for the type and size of projects you intend to take on
- Some applicants also provide a **surety bond** or **cash deposit** as additional proof of financial responsibility

### Insurance Requirements

Before you can activate your license, you need:

- **General liability insurance** with minimum coverage as required by your projects and any local requirements
- **Workers' compensation insurance** if you have employees, or a valid exemption if you are a sole proprietor with no employees

### Application Process

1. **Gather your documentation:** experience verification, financial statements, exam results, insurance certificates
2. **Submit your application** to the DBPR Construction Industry Licensing Board
3. **Pay the application fee:** approximately **$249** for the initial application plus exam fees of around **$200 to $300**
4. **Background check:** the DBPR runs a criminal background check on all applicants
5. **Board review:** the Construction Industry Licensing Board reviews your application, typically at their regular board meetings
6. **License issuance:** once approved, you receive your license and can begin operating

The entire process from starting your exam prep to holding a license typically takes **6 to 12 months** if everything goes smoothly.

### Continuing Education

Once licensed, you must complete **14 hours of continuing education every 2 years** to renew your license. This includes:

- 1 hour of workplace safety
- 1 hour of business practices
- 1 hour of workers' comp
- 1 hour of Florida laws and rules
- 7 hours of technical education (code updates, construction methods, etc.)
- 3 hours of electives

### Total Cost to Get Licensed

Here is a rough breakdown of what you will spend:

- Exam prep course: **$1,000 to $3,000**
- Code books and reference materials: **$300 to $600**
- Exam registration fees: **$200 to $300**
- DBPR application fee: **$249**
- CPA-prepared financial statement: **$500 to $2,000**
- Insurance (first year): **$2,000 to $5,000+** depending on coverage
- **Total: approximately $4,250 to $11,150**

### How Other States Compare

Florida's licensing requirements are among the toughest, but they are not unique. For comparison:

- **California** requires a similar exam and 4 years of experience
- **Texas** does not have a state-level GC license (licensing is handled at the city level)
- **Georgia** requires a combination of experience and exam
- **North Carolina** requires an exam and financial qualifications similar to Florida

If you plan to work in multiple states, each one has its own requirements. Your Florida license does not automatically transfer, though some states have reciprocity agreements.

### Is It Worth It?

Absolutely. A general contractor license in Florida opens the door to a career with strong demand, good income potential, and the satisfaction of building something real. Central Florida in particular has consistent demand for licensed contractors due to population growth, hurricane-related rebuilding, and ongoing development.

The barriers to entry are high, but that is by design. It keeps unqualified people out of an industry where mistakes can cost homeowners and occupants everything.

J&N StructureWorks is proud to be a licensed Florida Certified Building Contractor. We built our business the right way, by meeting every requirement, passing every exam, and earning our credentials through years of experience in the field.`
